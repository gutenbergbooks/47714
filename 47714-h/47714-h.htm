<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The coats-of-arms and crests which are figured and
described in the following pages do not exhaust the
number of stamps of this kind that must exist on bookbindings
throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Perhaps some day I shall go on my travels and search
for unrecorded coats, but the present collection, even if
it should prove to have been only a first instalment, will
not easily be equalled in interest.</p>

<p>Little attention has been hitherto paid to English
coats-of-arms outside books. For French coats of the
same kind an excellent and comprehensive handbook has
been compiled by M. J. Guigard, <i>Nouvel Armorial du
Bibliophile</i>, Paris, 1890.</p>

<p>Two short papers have already been written about
my present subject, and both of these are illustrated with
drawings by myself. The earlier paper is by Mr. W. Y.
Fletcher, and appeared in vol. iii. of <i>Bibliographica</i> in 1897;
it is called "English Armorial Book-Stamps and their
Owners." The second paper is by Mr. A. W. Pollard, and
appeared in <i>The Library</i> of April 1902; it is called "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Franks Collection of Armorial Book-Stamps." The
drawings I made for these two papers were carefully drawn
exactly as the stamps were cut, and consequently look
very black; in my newer drawings, however, I have in
many cases only given the outlines of supporters, crests,
helmets, and accessories generally, the effect of which is
less heavy and equally useful for identification.</p>

<p>Armorial devices stamped on the outsides of books
occur in England from the end of the fifteenth century
onwards, and very fine examples are found of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries particularly. Towards
the end of the seventeenth century the popularity of
the book-stamp was diminished by the growth of the
use of adhesive book-plates. It may be mentioned that,
especially during the reign of Elizabeth, many fine
armorial woodcuts are found in English books, the arms
being generally those of the patron to whom the book
was dedicated.</p>

<p>The succession of English Royal coats-of-arms on
books is complete from the time of Henry VII. to that of
Edward VII., and they will all be found in this book.
The usual authorities for Royal armorials are great seals
and coins, but the books which belonged to our sovereigns
supply an equally fine and equally accurate collection.
Every change of bearings, supporters, mottoes or badges
is duly represented, and there are very few old private
libraries in England which have not some Royal books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
upon their shelves. These books have either been given
away by the sovereigns themselves, or acquired as official
perquisites.</p>

<p>With regard to the identification of coats-of-arms or
crests on books, this is a process of exhaustion, and it will
be found easiest to begin with accessories, if there are
any. These accessories are found either as augmentations
<i>on</i> the shield or additions <i>outside</i> it, and by their help
it is often easy to narrow down the limits within which
the owner must come. By the help of coronets it
is possible to fix the exact rank of the owner, and this
alone, together with the date of the book, ought to
make the identification easy, by help of a Peerage of
the same date.</p>

<p>The decorations which surround a shield are often
of great use; the coat-of-arms and coronet of an Earl, for
instance, may be easily identified, but there may nevertheless
be three or four persons who succeeded each other
rapidly, and bore the same coat, to whom the book may
have belonged. But round such a coat perhaps there is
the Garter, or the collar of the Bath, or the insignia of
some other order, and this will very likely decide which
Earl was the actual owner.</p>

<p>The date of the printing of a book is of some use, if
everything else fails, but it must be understood that as a
rule it only means that the binding belonged to somebody
at a later date. Even that is not quite certain, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
old stamped bindings have too often been transferred
to newer books. Such a transfer would be evident to a
binder, but it may well deceive any one else.</p>

<p>The large majority of the stamps illustrated herewith
are in the British Museum, but I have included a few in
private ownership, and to these owners my sincere thanks
are due for their kindness in allowing me to copy the
various coats. I have in every case mentioned this
private ownership, and where such mention is not found
the book from which the drawing has been made is in
the British Museum, either in the Department of Printed
Books or in the Department of Manuscripts.</p>

<p>Heraldry is of military origin, but its decorative side,
and the various exact rules which govern it, were
probably brought into use during the Middle Ages,
in connection with the frequent Tournaments which
were governed by strict rules. The ceremonies to be
followed at the Tournaments were very closely laid down;
heralds as well as their assistants of all sorts came into
much prominence, and personal insignia acquired an
importance they have never had since. Even now there
are a few signs of ancient personal heraldry existing in
our army; crests and tartans of private families may be
found among the Highland regiments, but the modern
tendency, especially since the late war in South Africa,
has been to abolish such peculiarities.</p>

<p>To Blazon is to describe the different divisions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
bearings on a coat-of-arms in proper sequence and in
heraldic language, so that an heraldic artist can, from
the description, draw and colour the coat correctly.</p>

<p>The colours of shields and bearings ought to be
given in every case, either of blazon or illustration;
but as this is not always convenient, two methods
of indicating colours have been adopted. The first
is known as Trick, and in this manner colours were
marked until the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In Trick the colours or tinctures are indicated by
letters, and they are described in Gerard Legh's <i>Accedens
of Armory</i>, London, 1562, as follows:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>O. Or.  Yelowe.    A. Argent.  Whyghte.</li>
<li>G. Geules, betweene Red and Tenne.</li>
<li>B. Azure, bright Blewe.   V. Vert.  Grene.</li>
<li>P. Purpure. Purple.    E. Ermyn.  White poudred w^t Black.</li>
<li>Es. Ermines.  Black powdred whight.    T. Tenne.  Orynge coloure.</li>
<li>M. Sangwyne.  Murreye.    Pr. Proper coloure.  Naturall.</li>
<li>BB. Blewe.  Sad Blewe.</li>
</ul>

<p>The letters are put either in the spaces or on the
charges to which they refer, or they may be found in the
margin with a directing line drawn to the proper place.</p>

<p>Several other methods of indicating colour by means
of black and white lines laid in certain directions have
been tried, but they have all failed to stand the test of
time except that invented by an Italian Jesuit Father,
Silvestro Petra Sancta, who lived in the seventeenth
century. His method is figured and described in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
book he wrote and illustrated on Italian coats-of-arms.
It is a very useful book, because the coats are arranged
according to the devices upon them. It is in fact an
illustrated ordinary of Italian arms, <i>Tesserae Gentilitiae</i>,
Romae, 1638.</p>

<p>The colours and lines given by Father Petra Sancta
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Nigrum</p></div>
</div>

<p>These are still the commonest colours, but a few
more have been added since; they are, however, rarely
used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i_018a.jpg" width="249" height="259" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Besides the metals and the colours a few furs are
used in heraldry; the two most usual of these are Ermine
and Vair. Ermine is white and shows little conventional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
spots on it, which represent the black tips of the tails
of the same animal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/i_018b.jpg" width="252" height="260" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Vair is supposed to represent little grey squirrel
skins spread out and arranged touching each other. It
is coloured blue and white.</p>

<p>The others, rarely found, are variations on one or
other of these two.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Ermines shows white tails on a black ground.</p>

<p>Erminois shows black tails on a gold ground.</p>

<p>Erminites is the same as Ermine, but each black tail has one outer
red hair on each side.</p>

<p>Pean shows gold tails on a black ground.</p>

<p>Counter Vair has the skins differently arranged.</p>

<p>Potent is like Vair, but the skins are differently shaped, like thick T's.</p>

<p>Counter Potent has the Potent skins differently arranged.</p></div>

<p>The heraldic lines, dots, and furs should be learnt,
as they must be understood and are continually met with
in heraldic works of late date. The tincture lines do not
show on English Royal book-stamps until the time of
George II., and on earlier book-stamps the want of
any indication of colour is a great element of doubt in
the attribution of coats-of-arms to particular persons,
in the absence of assistance from marks outside the
shields, coronets, helmets, crests, and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>An heraldic heiress is a lady whose father is armigerous
but leaves no son. In such a case the lady's
coat, if she married, would be shown on an escutcheon
of Pretence placed in the centre of her husband's coat,
and may be shown as a quartering on the coats-of-arms
of her children.</p>

<p>Marshalling is the manner and method of conjoining
divers arms upon one shield according to heraldic
precedent and usage; it is an exact process.</p>

<p>The marshalling of the many family coats which
may be inherited through marriages with heraldic
heiresses is often a very elaborate and difficult matter.
The rules, however, for such marshalling are well known
and logical. A very good summary of this important
part of a herald's duty can be found in Mr. A. C. Fox
Davies's <i>Art of Heraldry</i>, in the chapter on Marshalling.
A coat-of-arms is, however, sometimes found with many
quarterings which only show the successive alliances,
but in such a case the facts should always be stated.
In default of such explanation the existence of the proper
heraldic heiress rights must always be presumed.</p>

<p>When a man quarters the coat-of-arms of an ancestral
heiress, he has also the right to use the crest belonging
to it. The right of bearing a crest, although not
allowed to ladies, seems to be latent in them, as it can
be inherited through them, if heiresses, by their male
descendants. But in ordinary English usage it is usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
only to use one crest, except in the case of an assumption
by Royal Licence of an additional surname, coat-of-arms,
and crest. In German heraldry such quartered coats
are usually accompanied by all their respective crests,
which are placed along the top of the coat in an arched
line, each on its proper helmet, and all facing inwards.</p>

<p>Distinctive personal marks on English shields are
few; the commonest is the Ulster hand which is used
as an augmentation by Baronets. The rank of Baronet,
which is hereditary, was instituted by James I. in 1611.
By the original Statutes of the Order, Baronets in order
to qualify for the rank had to maintain "thirty soldiers
three years at eightpence a day in the Province of
Ulster in Ireland." A Baronet had to prove that he
was a gentleman by birth and to possess property to the
value of &pound;1000 per annum.</p>

<p>The arms of Ulster are a red left hand appaum&eacute; on
a silver ground, and the origin of this curious coat is
said to be that on an Irish expedition for the acquisition
of new territory in ancient days, the ancestor of the
O'Neiles, finding that an adversary was reaching the
coveted shore more quickly than he was, cut off his left
hand, and threw it ashore, thereby establishing a "first
landing" claim to the new territory. The claim was
allowed, and so the successful chieftain became the first
king of Ulster and the ancestor of the succeeding kings.</p>

<p>The Ulster hand, either with or without its silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
shield, usually shows either on the honour point in the
centre of a shield, in the dexter chief, or in the centre
chief, but there is no definite rule as to its position.</p>

<p>In 1625 a similar hereditary rank was instituted for
Nova Scotia in North America, but since 1801 all
Baronets have been "of the United Kingdom." The
Baronets of Ulster and of the United Kingdom both use
the Ulster hand as their symbol, borne upon their shield,
but the Baronets of Nova Scotia indicate their rank in
another way. The badge of a Baronet of Nova Scotia
hangs from the base of his shield, suspended by a tawny
ribbon; the badge is oval, and shows "argent, a saltire
azure, thereon an inescutcheon of the arms of Scotland
ensigned with an Imperial Crown, the whole encircled
by a fillet on which are the words '<span class="smcap">FAX MENTIS HONESTAE
GLORIA</span>.'"</p>

<p>Concerning the Knights of the English Langue of
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Guillim says that
they may wear "their Paternal coat armour insigned
with this cross on the chief of their Paternal Coat."
The cross he speaks of is, he says, that of Amadeus, Earl
of Savoy (Gu., a cross argent), who fought in company
with the Knights of St. John at the Siege of Acre in the
thirteenth century, and, the Grand Master being slain,
put on his dress and demeaned himself so gallantly that
he was asked to allow the Order to adopt his coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>In the Charter of Incorporation of this Order granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
by Queen Victoria in 1888, it is ordained that "Knights
of Justice may bear the Arms of the Order, viz. Gules,
a cross argent embellished alternately in each of the
principal angles with a Lion guardant and a Unicorn,
both passant or," as a chief on their coat-of-arms. The
lion and the unicorn were added to the then existing
arms of the English Langue of the Order by
George IV.</p>

<p>Knights of other Orders and Knights Bachelors do
not, as such, use any augmentations on their shields.</p>

<p>Several forms of marks of cadency are given in the
<i>Book of St. Albans</i>, printed in the fifteenth century, and
many more had been used in medi&aelig;val times, but
the manner of indicating cadency which has lasted until
the present day is the only one that it is necessary to
describe here.</p>

<p>In an old window at St. Mary's Church, Warwick,
the six sons of the Earl of Warwick, who died in the
thirty-fourth year of Edward III., are marked by the six
following devices on their shields:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 191px;">

<div class="caption"><p>6th, a Fleur-de-lys</p></div>
</div>

<p>Gerard Legh in his <i>Accedens of Armory</i> mentions
three more such marks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>7th, a Rose. 8th, a Cross moline. 9th, a double
Quatrefoil.</p></div>

<p>The first six are often met with, but the last three
very rarely.</p>

<p>The Royal Family all use labels as cadency marks,
distinguished by charges upon them, or by the number of
points, differences which are all specially granted, the eldest
son always wearing a plain silver label of three points.</p>

<p>English coronets seem to have followed a definite line
of development, but they were not actually settled as
to their respective designs until the time of Charles II.,
at whose coronation all the ranks of the Peerage carried
their respective coronets exactly in their present form.</p>

<p>At first coronets of rank were only circlets of metal,
then on this circlet were put balls or "pearls" (as in the
portrait of King Alfred on the Dowgate Hill brooch, or
the coronet of a Baron or Viscount), then the pearls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ornamentally tripled, and this trefoil soon turned into a
leaf form (<i>e.g.</i> the coronet of an Earl or Marquis, alternately
pearls and leaves), and finally leaves alone figure as the
mark of the highest peerage rank of a subject (<i>e.g.</i> the
coronet of a Duke, leaves only).</p>

<p>The Royal Crown has gone through a similar line of
development, but in this case the trefoil has evolved into
two different forms, that of the cross patt&eacute;e, and that of
the fleur-de-lys. These forms became fixed in the time
of Henry VII., the existing crown of England being
essentially of the same pattern as that then finally
adopted, arches and all.</p>

<p>While fully appreciating the fact that the forms of
modern coronets only date from the time of Charles II.,
it is still interesting to inquire by what methods peers of
earlier date marked their dignity pictorially, and it seems
that this was done by means of the use of a crest-chapeau,
and the use of a helmet under it. But in sculpture certain
forms of coronets also appear. Crowns and coronets are
placed immediately upon the top of the shield. Over
the crown or coronet comes the helmet, and over the
helmet the crest.</p>

<p>The Royal Crown of England has followed a definite
line of development, and, as mentioned above, it reached
its present form in the time of Henry VII., but, curiously
enough, on the only known book-stamp that is attributed
to this king the crown is shown in a more ancient form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that of a circlet ornamented with fleurs-de-lys of
different sizes. The centre cross patt&eacute;e on the English
crown was not used before it was invented by Henry VI.,
and it first shows on his seal for foreign affairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/i_025a.jpg" width="395" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Royal Crown of England now has upon the
circlet four crosses patt&eacute;e and four fleurs-de-lys, and from
the tops of the crosses rise two complete
arches, bearing a mound and cross
at their point of junction. The Stuart
crowns often show two more arches,
rising from the tops of the fleurs-de-lys,
and this peculiarity was lately shown on the diamond
crown made for the coronation of Queen Alexandra.
The Royal crowns are richly jewelled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_025b.jpg" width="400" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The coronet of the Prince of Wales is the same as the
crown of the Sovereign, except that it has only one
arch and no jewels. The single arch was granted, for
the future, by Charles II.; before that
the princely coronet had no arch. The
older form of this coronet can still be
seen on the Prince of Wales's badge
of three ostrich feathers, which are
held together by a coronet of the old shape. The three
feathers are said to have been the badge of John, King
of Bohemia, who was killed by the Black Prince at Cr&eacute;cy
in 1346. The motto "<span class="smcap">Ich Dien</span>" also belonged to
the King of Bohemia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/i_026a.jpg" width="391" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The coronets of younger children of the Sovereign
are the same as that of the Prince of
Wales, but without the arch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/i_026b.jpg" width="403" height="164" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The coronets of Princes, grandchildren
of the Sovereign, are the same as those of the
younger children of the Sovereign, except
that the two outer crosses patt&eacute;e
are replaced by strawberry leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/i_026c.jpg" width="385" height="168" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Charles II. settled all these matters as they now are,
and also ordained that Princes, grandchildren
or nephews of the Sovereign,
being also Dukes, should wear on their
coronets four crosses patt&eacute;e alternately with four strawberry
leaves.</p>

<p>The Black Prince was the first English Duke. The
title derives from Dux, a leader, and was, and still is, a
sovereign title in many instances. The Black Prince was
created a Duke in 1337 by his father Edward III. On
the Prince's tomb at Canterbury he wears over his helmet
a coronet which shows ten or more leaves on short
pyramidal points rising from the circlet. The present
ducal coronet is probably a survival of this form. The
Black Prince's helmet with chapeau and crest is also preserved
at Canterbury. On the tomb of John Beaufort,
Duke of Somerset (1444), at Wimborne Minster, he is
shown wearing a coronet set with several trefoils or leaves
rising from the circlet. The same design shows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>Prince Arthur's Book</i> (1501-2) at the College of
Arms, where the banner of Charles Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk, is ensigned with a coronet bearing several leaves
resembling strawberry leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/i_027a.jpg" width="433" height="184" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the coronation of Edward VII., the official
description of a Duke's coronet is "of silver gilt, and
on the circle eight strawberry leaves."
Pictorially five of these leaves are
shown.</p>

<p>The first English Marquis was Robert de Vere,
created Marquis of Dublin by Richard II. in 1387. A
Lord Marcher was a Governor or Ruler of the Marches,
or Frontiers, but the dignity did not become hereditary
until the fourteenth century. It was a position of much
importance and responsibility. The coronet of a Marquis
is nearly the same as that of a Duke, but each alternate
leaf is turned into a silver ball or pearl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/i_027b.jpg" width="426" height="191" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the coronation of Edward VII., the official description
of a Marquis's coronet is "of silver gilt, and on the
circle four gold strawberry leaves and
four silver balls alternately, the latter
a little raised on points above the
rim." Pictorially three strawberry leaves and two pearls
are shown.</p>

<p>The title of Earl, or Eorl, is one of Anglo-Saxon
origin, and probably derived from the Danish Jarl.
Eorls were warriors and had charge of shires, but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Normans they were called Counts. It is the oldest
English title of nobility.</p>

<p>The Saxon form of name has, however, in this case,
proved the most lasting, but the remains of the Norman
nomenclature exist in the title of Countess, and also in
the name County. The Earl or Shire man had his
deputy, the Sheriff, and he became the Vice-count or
"Viscount." Hugh Lupus, created Earl of Chester
by the Conqueror, is said to have been the first
properly constituted English hereditary Earl. The
coronet worn by Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, in
the early fourteenth century, and which is said by
Sandford to have been shown on the Earl's tomb in
St. Paul's Cathedral, was a simple circlet; and so is
that worn by William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,
who died in the thirteenth century, on his tomb at
Westminster.</p>

<p>Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the mother of
Henry VII., wears, on her tomb at Westminster, a
coronet with eight leaves and eight pearls on points;
essentially the same form of a Countess's coronet as used
now. But on her seal she uses a circlet from which rise
alternately roses and fleurs-de-lys, five roses and four
fleurs-de-lys, each on a short pyramidal point. This
shows that at that time there was no definite pattern.</p>

<p>On the tomb, at Windsor, of Charles Somerset, Earl
of Worcester, who died about the middle of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
century, is a coronet with nine trefoils, or leaves, of
equal size, and his son Henry, Earl of Worcester (<i>d.</i> 1549),
on his tomb in the Parish Church at Chepstow, shows a
coronet of leaves and pearls, all on short pyramidal stems,
rising from the circlet. Except for the proportion of
the stems this coronet is the same as that now used.
At a little later date, in Elizabeth's reign, I think
the Earl's coronet took definite shape, and, among others,
it shows both on the seals of Dudley, Earl of Leicester,
and Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, essentially in
its present form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="437" height="243" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the coronation of Edward VII. the official description
of an Earl's coronet is "of silver
gilt, and on the circle eight silver balls
raised upon points, with gold strawberry
leaves between the points."
Pictorially five points with pearls and four strawberry
leaves are shown.</p>

<p>A Viscount is a Vicecomes, or deputy for a Count or
Earl. The Earls have retained their Saxon name, but
the Viscount has kept the Norman equivalent of their
rank as Sheriffs. Both the Earl and his Viscount were
originally county officials. Since 1441 the title has
been one of hereditary rank. The first English Viscount
was John, Viscount Beaumont, so created by Henry VI.
The first English Viscount to wear a coronet was
Robert, Lord Cecil of Effingdon, who was created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Viscount Cranbourn by James I. in 1605, and his
coronet was essentially the same as is now used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="392" height="166" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the coronation of Edward VII., the official description
of a Viscount's coronet is "of silver gilt and on
the circle sixteen silver balls." Pictorially
nine of these silver balls are
shown.</p>

<p>The Barons are probably the modern representatives
of the ancient Saxon Thanes. It is an old Norman name
for the Thane, and it is found often enough in ancient
documents. Guillim says that citizens of London were
called "Barons Londonni," and in <i>Domesday</i> there is
mention of Barons of Warwick. There were Barons of
the Exchequer, and there are still the Barons of the
Cinque Ports. But none of these were hereditary
titles.</p>

<p>Edward III., however, created William de la Pole
an hereditary Baron, and since that time the dignity has
been generally hereditary. Baronies were at first held
by Tenure, that is by reason of the existence of adequate
territorial possessions, and Guillim says that this essential
was forgone by Henry III., who created Barons by
Writ. In later times, when the rank became hereditary,
Baronies by Writ have been heritable through the
female line, and because of this, Baronial titles have in
many instances been held by several allied families, with
different family names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The coronet of a Baron was originally a plain circlet,
but Charles II. ordained that in future there should be
six balls upon it, and the Barons at his coronation wore
such additional ornamentation. In Ireland, however,
this form of Barons' coronets had already been fixed by
James I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_031a.jpg" width="381" height="172" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the coronation of Edward VII., the official description
of a Baron's coronet is "of silver
gilt and on the circle six silver balls
at equal distances." Pictorially four
silver balls are shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_031b.jpg" width="417" height="208" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The coronet of a King-of-Arms is of silver gilt, and
on the circlet is inscribed the words
"<span class="smcap">MISERERE MEI DEUS SECUNDUM MAGNAM
MISERICORDIAM TUAM</span>," taken from
the 51st Psalm. From the circlet rise alternately long
and short oak leaves.</p>

<p>The Kings-of-Arms, Heralds, and Pursuivants were
incorporated as a College by Richard III. in 1483,
and Derby House in the city, now the College of
Arms, was given to them as their headquarters in 1555.
Kings-of-Arms wore coronets from the beginning; a
portrait of William Bruges, the first Garter King-of-Arms,
in 1420, in an illuminated manuscript, shows
him wearing a coronet on which are four trefoils, or
leaves, upon short pyramidal stems. On the grant of
arms of the Tallow Chandlers' Company, John Smert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Garter King-of-Arms in 1456, is shown wearing a
coronet on which are three leaves and two pearls or
balls. Sir William Dugdale, Garter King-of-Arms during
the latter half of the seventeenth century, wore a coronet
with twelve oak leaves of equal height on the circlet,
on which there was no inscription. The coronet as
now used was probably first decided upon early in the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Heralds and Kings-of-Arms are entitled to surround
their arms with the ancient collar of SS. The same
honour is allowed to the Serjeants-at-Arms and several
of the Judges.</p>

<p>Imitation jewels are repouss&eacute; upon the circlets of
all these coronets, except those of Barons and Heralds.
No English crowns or coronets, except those worn by
the Sovereign or the Queen Consort, have any real
jewels upon them.</p>

<p>Crowns and coronets are only officially worn in
England on the occasion of the coronation, and then
with the ordered coronation dress. They are put on
when the crown is put upon the head of the Sovereign.
But if they are held over the head of the owner it
appears to be sufficient, as in Sir George Hayter's
beautiful picture of the coronation of Queen Victoria,
the Duchess of Cambridge is shown with a Lady-in-Waiting
holding her coronet over her head. The
Duchess was wearing a very handsome diamond tiara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which, no doubt, she considered more becoming than
her coronet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="424" height="319" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Crowns and coronets are properly depicted without
any cap within them, but when they are worn it is
always over the Peer's cap, known variously as a Cap
of Estate, of Maintenance, or of Dignity. The same
cap is also used in many early instances as a crest-chapeau.
The cap is the same for all
ranks, from the Sovereign to the King-of-Arms;
it consists of a red velvet
cap lined with white silk and turned
up with miniver, which is white
ermine fur having small dots or tufts of black horsehair
sewn into it at intervals. At the top is an ornamental
gold button, with fringes of gold thread.</p>

<p>The earliest figure of a cap of this sort can be
seen on the Black Prince's helmet over his tomb at
Canterbury; it has been painted red and miniver,
but is now in a very bad condition. The crest stands
upon it.</p>

<p>The Cap of Estate, without any crown or coronet
over it, is worn by the Sovereign on the way to the
coronation, and it is also generally borne on a cushion
by one of the great officers of State when the Sovereign
is present in State or Semi-State. It is carried by the
Marquis of Winchester or his representative. Peers used
such caps pictorially before they showed coronets, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
fifteenth and sixteenth century seals the Cap of Estate
marks a high rank. It commonly shows on the seals of
Dukes and Earls in conjunction with a helmet. The
chapeau in early times seems to end in two swallow-tails,
but now it is worn round. As a crest support
in modern times it is rarely granted, but there still
remain a few instances of its use.</p>

<p>Although it is correct to depict coronets without
the Cap of Estate, it is also correct to show them with
it. In the latter case the miniver turn-up comes just
below the lower rim of the circlet. It is a common
mistake to show the miniver turn-up without the velvet
Cap above it, which is obviously absurd.</p>

<p>In the absence of a crown or coronet the Helmet
rests directly on the upper part of a shield. In fifteenth
and sixteenth century seals it shows very large in comparison
with the coat-of-arms, and so does the crest;
the helmet often shows the guige or shield belt, and
the shield often hangs <i>couch&eacute;e</i> or sideways. The Helmet,
so says Guillim, is the true mark of English nobility,
and it certainly shows as such on seals dating from the
fourteenth until about the end of the sixteenth century,
when rank coronets began to be used instead of, or
together with, a corresponding form of helmet.</p>

<p>From the early seventeenth century the shapes and
metals of the helmets denoting rank have been clearly
laid down, and they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 132px;">
<img src="images/i_035a.jpg" width="132" height="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Royal.</i>&mdash;A Helmet of Gold, with six bars,
set affront&eacute;e.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 114px;">
<img src="images/i_035b.jpg" width="114" height="142" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Peers.</i>&mdash;A Helmet of Silver, barred, with
    five bars, and garnished gold, usually
    set in profile, but Dukes sometimes
    used it affront&eacute;e.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/i_035c.jpg" width="136" height="149" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Baronets</i> and <i>Knights</i>.&mdash;A Helmet of Steel,
  garnished with silver, without bars, the
  visor open, and set affront&eacute;e.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 112px;">
<img src="images/i_035d.jpg" width="112" height="148" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Esquires.</i>&mdash;A Helmet of Steel, the visor
  closed, and set in profile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the Helmet, between it and the crest support,
comes the mantling, the survival of the helmet cover
torn in war, and showing in strips, now ornamentally
treated. The main metals and colours of the coat-of-arms
should be repeated in the mantling.</p>

<p>To wear a crest at a Tournament implied more social
status than the possession of a shield, and in the latter
part of the fourteenth century all great nobles were very
careful to display their crests, but lesser gentry had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
content with their shields only. In early visitations coats-of-arms
were frequently granted without crest at all.</p>

<p>Later, in Jacobean times, crests were sometimes given
to persons already bearing arms, and they became
commoner. Whenever ancestral coats-of-arms are
quartered with a given coat, the corresponding crests
may also be worn, but in English usage this is rarely
done. In the event, however, of an additional surname
being adopted by Royal Licence, with the corresponding
coat-of-arms and crest, the second crest is commonly used;
but it is very rare in English Heraldry to show more than
two crests.</p>

<p>Crests are undoubtedly derived from the fact that in
the days of Armour, Knights were completely covered up
and required some evident mark by which they could be
recognised. To meet this difficulty a coloured device set
on the top of a man's helmet offered an obvious and
ornamental solution. Such a crest was strictly personal;
the retainers of a Knight wore his badge and his colours,
but never his crest. The modern use of livery colours
and badges can be well seen in the case of the Beefeaters
at the Tower. Very ancient helmets were sometimes
ornamentally coloured.</p>

<p>The crest "Crista," a cockscomb, was often of a fan
or cockscomb shape on the top of a helmet, but gradually
it assumed more distinguishing peculiarities. On the
Great Seal of Richard I., on the equestrian side, a cocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>comb
crest shows on the King's helmet, with a lion of
England on the flat base of it. The whole coat-of-arms
sometimes shows on the Fan crest, as it does in the
crest of the City of London. The original Fan, however,
in this instance, has become curiously modified into the
shape of a dragon's wing.</p>

<p>Crests are carried on some sort of support; those
usually found are one or other of the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>On a crest-chapeau, the old cap of maintenance, dignity, or of estate.
It was, and is, usually used by persons of high rank. The
earliest remaining example of the use of the crest-chapeau is in
Canterbury Cathedral, and a model of one is there on the helmet
of the Black Prince, over his tomb. The cap is of red velvet
turned up with miniver; it is not a round cap like its modern
representative, but is of an elongated shape, ending in two
swallow-tails.</p>

<p>Issuing from an heraldic coronet showing three strawberry leaves, the
colour of the coronet being exemplified in the official grant.
This coronet does not appear to have any meaning.</p>

<p>Issuing from a Mural coronet, sometimes granted to Army officers.</p>

<p>Issuing from a Naval coronet, sometimes granted to Naval officers.</p>

<p>On a fillet or twisted torse of the chief metal and chief colour of the
coat-of-arms with which it is used. This fillet is the commonest
crest support, and the others, chapeau or coronet, are
themselves sometimes set upon a torse. It should be stated in
the grant.</p></div>

<p>Crests carry the same cadency marks as occur on the
coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>Crests are of very ancient use; marks of dignity worn
upon the head are among the earliest signs of chieftainship
used by mankind. A savage chief would readily
wear a rare bird's feather in his head as a mark of dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
or even his own hair matted into particular forms, as the
Zulus still do. As for feathers, we still wear them on our
heads as indications of rank; they can be found on the
ceremonial hats of all the great Orders of Knighthood, on
the hats of the Staff of our army as well as on several
Regimental head-dresses, and on the hats of our Civil
Servants.</p>

<p>Knights and Companions, or Esquires, of Orders of
Knighthood show the badge or badges of the Order or
Orders to which they belong suspended from the proper
ribbon from the base of their shields. Medals are seldom
so shown. Knights Commanders of Orders of Knighthood
usually, in addition, surround their coats-of-arms
with the ribbon and motto of their senior Order. From
this ribbon may depend the badges of all the Orders to
which the Knight belongs. Knights Grand Cross may
further surround their coats-of-arms with the collars of
any or all the Orders having collars to which they
belong, the badge of each depending from its proper
collar. When several collars are shown they are sometimes
halved, each badge always being so arranged as to
hang from a link of its own collar.</p>

<p>Many officials besides those already mentioned are
entitled to show emblems of their office outside their
shields, but few of these show on book-stamps. An
instance, however, may be seen on one of the stamps
used by Samuel Pepys, where he shows two anchors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
behind his shield as a mark of his position as Secretary
to the Admiralty. In the same way Field-Marshals
are entitled to place crossed batons behind their
shields.</p>

<p>Clergymen of high rank sometimes ensign their coats-of-arms
with a Mitre, but as non-combatants they use no
crests. Archbishops and Bishops impale the Arms of
their See with their own paternal coats, the official coat
taking the dexter position. Deans also and lesser ecclesiastical
dignitaries in many cases impale their family coats
with an official one, in the same way.</p>

<p>The origin of Supporters to coats-of-arms is a matter
upon which there is much difference of opinion. It is
probable that as now used they are partly of utilitarian
and partly of decorative origin. Badges and charges on
coats-of-arms have often developed into Supporters.
Henry VIII., in 1528, borrowed one of the lions of
England from his coat-of-arms and adopted him as
a Dexter Supporter, a dignity he has retained ever
since.</p>

<p>At Tournaments, before the combatants entered the
Lists their banners and shields were displayed and held
by retainers or pages. These serving-men were dressed
in their Lord's livery or in some fancy dress. So that a
Knight's shield would be recognised not only by the
devices upon it, but also by the colours and appearance of
its Supporter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Many foreign shields, and ancient English ones also,
show only one Supporter, and it is likely enough that
when pictorial heraldry began generally to show Supporters,
a second Supporter was often added for the sake of
uniformity alone. In King Arthur's Book at the College
of Arms, illuminated quite early in the sixteenth century,
banners are shown with only one Supporter holding them
up.</p>

<p>Supporters were regularly used by persons of high
rank from early in the fifteenth century; they carry on
them any marks of cadency which may be on the shield
to which they belong. The right to use Supporters
depends upon the wording of the grant of Arms concerned.
Practically they are now seldom granted except to Peers.
In the past, however, many commoners have been granted
Supporters for their coats-of-arms, by Royal Warrant, and
some of these are hereditary. This is a point which
would be specified in the grant, and without such
specification the Supporters would not be hereditary.</p>

<p>In Scotland ancient usage is allowed to be a good
cause for using Supporters.</p>

<p>Supporters have at present no defined status, they indicate
no rank; but the tendency now is to restrict their
use, and it is quite probable that some day they will
become actual evidences of Peerage rank, as they probably
originally were. No list of English Heraldic Supporters
has yet been published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Mottoes largely derive from War-cries. In England
they are not mentioned in grants of arms, and very rarely
in visitation books. Mottoes are not hereditary, but can
be changed at the will of any armigerous person. Officers
of arms will record mottoes by request, provided they do
not infringe any existing rights.</p>

<p>In Scotland, however, mottoes are recognised officially;
they are subject to grant, and their position with regard
to the coat-of-arms or crest to which they belong is
specified. Heraldic mottoes appear to have been used
in England in the sixteenth century; they show on
some of the Garter Plates at Windsor. Mottoes often
accompanied badges, and in many cases they may have
been transferred from them to the coat-of-arms or to
the crest.</p>

<p>The motto "<span class="smcap">Dieu et Mon Droit</span>" was adopted
by Edward III., in allusion to his claim to the
Throne of France. In 1801, on the Legislative union of
Great Britain and Ireland, the title of King of France, as
well as the coat-of-arms of France which had appeared
on the English coat-of-arms ever since the time of
Edward III., was discontinued, but the motto has been
retained and is still used. Useful lists of English mottoes
are given in several editions of Burke's <i>Peerage</i>, and in the
1905 edition of Fairbairn's <i>Crests</i>.</p>

<p>Some elementary knowledge of heraldic terms and
bearings must be acquired before it is possible to use any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the ordinaries, or lists of coats-of-arms, arranged
according to the divisions of shields and the bearings
upon them.</p>

<p>Fortunately the primary and, at the same time, the
most important divisions of a shield are few and easily
learnt. They had originally a structural origin, and
although I begin with a line in my analysis, it is likely
that the charges were originally first; for instance, a red
scarf tied across the top of a shield would develop
heraldically into "a chief gu." In the same way a red
scarf tied from top to bottom of an iron shield would
become heraldically "sa., a pale gu." and so on. There
are now proper proportions for all these charges, but in
practice they are not strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>A large number of coats are not divided up at all, but
are simply charged with bearings that may be easily
identified if the colours are known; such coats have frequently
animal forms upon them, a Lion rampant or an
Eagle displayed, or more than one animal arranged in a
certain order. Such coats can generally be easily found
in an Ordinary, but the colour in old seals and on old
books is seldom given, and this often makes any unsupported
identification very doubtful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="138" height="140" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The shield may be divided by a centre
perpendicular line from top to bottom; this
is called division <i>per Pale</i>, and when the
dividing line is thickened it becomes a charge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
is described "a Pale." A husband impales his wife's
coat with his own, on the sinister side,
except when the lady is an heraldic heiress,
when her coat will be found on an
escutcheon of Pretence in the centre of
her husband's shield. Children of such a marriage are
entitled to quarter their mother's coat with their paternal
coat. They can also use any ancestral quarterings to
which their mother was entitled.</p>

<img src="images/i_043c.jpg" width="250" height="245" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When a shield is divided by a central horizontal line
it is said to be divided <i>per Fess</i>,
and when the dividing line is
thickened it becomes a charge and
is called "a Fess." Several small
fesses are called bars, or the shield may be described
as "Barry."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<img src="images/i_043e.jpg" width="250" height="254" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If the perpendicular pale and the horizontal fess
lines are combined, a shield becomes "Quartered" or
"Quarterly," and if these lines are
thickened we get the Cross, of
which there are several varieties,
<i>e.g.</i> cross patt&eacute;e, with the ends
flattened out like feet; cross crosslet with each end
crossed by a little bar; cross moline with double-pointed
ends; cross fleury with triple-pointed ends, and so on.
If a shield is covered all over with reduplications of the
quartering lines, so as to be divided into a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of little squares, or quarterings, it is said to be chequy
or compony.</p>

</div>

<p>When a shield is divided diagonally, either from
right to left, or from left to right, which must be
specified, it is said to be <i>per Bend</i>,
dexter or sinister, as the case
may be. If either of these lines
is thickened so as to become a
charge it is called "a Bend" (dexter or sinister). If
the dexter and sinister dividing Bend lines are combined,
a division <i>per Saltire</i> is
the result, and if these lines are
thickened so as to become a
charge, it is called "a Saltire." If
the upper triangle in the Saltire is drawn down into a
narrow point and forms a charge, it is called "a Pile."
There may be several of these, and their
number, position, and colour are always stated.
If the Saltire lines are repeated so as to cover
the entire shield with diamond-shaped spaces,
it is said to be Lozengy, and if these lines are thickened
so as to become charges, it is called Fretty, and the
little bars are interlaced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/i_044f.jpg" width="252" height="260" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If now the dividing lines of a quartered
coat and those of a coat divided per Saltire
be combined, we get a division known as
Gyronny, common in Scottish heraldry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 244px;">
<img src="images/i_045b.jpg" width="244" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If a shield is divided by an angular line in a gable
form, the two lowest lines of a division per Saltire,
it is called <i>per Chevron</i>, and if
this line is thickened so as to
become a charge, it is called a
Chevron.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/i_045c.jpg" width="254" height="249" alt="" />

<img src="images/i_045d.jpg" width="253" height="254" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When a third part of the top of a shield is marked off
by a horizontal line it forms what is called a Chief, and
when the top left-hand corner is
marked off as a small square,
measuring about a third of the
chief, it is called a Canton, and
is often an honourable augmentation to a coat-of-arms,
granted for some distinguished service.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_045e.jpg" width="250" height="248" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When a shield has a narrow border all
round it, it is called a Bordure, and this is also
often an honourable augmentation, difference,
or mark of cadency on a family coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>The boundary lines of all these charges are normally
straight, but they may also be either</p>

<p>and a few more which are rarely met with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Charges are usually placed on shields in certain
positions which follow one or other of the main lines of
division which have just been enumerated.</p>

<p>For instance, the three lions of England are arranged
one under the other, on an imaginary line running
from the top to the bottom of the shield. If such
a broad line existed it would be called a Pale, so the
lions are said to be "In, or Per Pale." Similarly,
they might be arranged "In Fess" or "In Bend,"
and so on.</p>

<p>All charges and bearings on shields should be shown
flat except</p>

<p>The Fret, which is interlaced.</p>

<p>Fretty, a small fret repeated, also interlaced.</p>

<p>Roundels in colour, which should be shown as hemispherical.
They doubtless represent the bosses on a
shield. The metal roundels, however, the Bezant of
gold, and the Plate of silver, no doubt represent coins,
and are shown flat; and that Cadency marks may
correctly be represented, as in relief on a shield.</p>

<p>Heraldic charges are numerous, and if any prolonged
investigation is likely to be required their
names and forms will have to be learnt. But a few
of the commoner charges may well be explained here,
as such explanation may possibly in many cases save a
long search.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/i_047a.jpg" width="161" height="191" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <i>Dragon</i> is a monster with scales all over him; he has
four legs ending in eagle's talons and a spear-head at the end of his
tail, his wings are like the wings of a bat, with a claw at the end of
each rib.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 167px;">
<img src="images/i_047b.jpg" width="167" height="203" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <i>Griffin</i> has the head, front legs, and wings of an
eagle, and the hind-quarters of a lion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 143px;">
<img src="images/i_047c.jpg" width="143" height="194" alt="" /></div>

<p>A <i>Wyvern</i> has a dragon's head and wings, with
two eagle's legs, his tail is curled round itself and ends in a
spear-point. He is scaly all over.</p>

<p>A <i>Cockatrice</i> is a Wyvern with a cock's head.</p>

<p>A <i>Basilisk</i> is a cockatrice with its tail ending in a dragon's head.</p>

<p>A <i>Lion</i> shows one eye, one ear, and stands upon one foot, rampant. He
has a mane, and his tail has a tuft at the end, and he shows no spots.
If a lion is otherwise depicted it must be mentioned in the blazon. A
lion showing two eyes and two ears is a lion "Leopard&eacute;."</p>

<p>A <i>Leopard</i> shows two eyes and two ears; he has no mane and his tail is
not tufted. He should show spots and be "nowhere shaggy." If he only
shows one eye and one ear he is a leopard "Lionn&eacute;."</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the other animals explain themselves, but
there are a few curious charges, no doubt survivals of
common forms, which also retain their ancient heraldic
names, and these forms and names are useful to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>member;

<p>Heraldic Shields changed their forms at different
periods, but it is not necessary to trouble much about
that here, as coats-of-arms on books are always simple in
shape. But it may be noted that unmarried ladies or
widows show their arms in the form of a Lozenge.
Guillim says, "This form is derived from the fusil, or
spindle for yarn, single women being called spinsters."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
The lozenge is an inconvenient form, and it is broadened
out whenever possible. When a wife's coat is shown on
an escutcheon of Pretence in the centre of her husband's
shield, it loses its lozenge form.</p>

<p>In view of a possible second volume in continuation
of the present, I should feel most grateful if any
librarians or owners of libraries will send me rubbings
of any more coats-of-arms on books that they know of.
To make a rubbing, from which I can make a drawing,
is quite easy. A piece of soft paper should be used, and
kept from slipping by a weight. Put the paper carefully
over the stamped part of the book, and then with the
finger gently press the paper down into the stamped
leather. When the design can just be distinguished,
rub over the paper, without letting it slip, with an
H.B. pencil cut to a broad round point, and it will be
found that in this way, with a little practice, every line
and dot in a stamp will show quite clearly. The
impressed lines on the leather will show as white on the
rubbing. From such a rubbing a drawing can be made.
Besides the rubbing, I should also like a copy of the title
of the book, and the name of the owner or library to
which it belongs.</p>

<p>I am aware that many of my attributions of coats in
the following pages are open to criticism, and I shall be
very grateful if any of my readers can correct any of them
with authority. At the end of the book I have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a short list of the books of reference, heraldic and
biographical, which I have found of most service in the
compilation of this book, and I gratefully record my
indebtedness to them all.</p>

<p>I have taken the Royal Titles from the respective
Great Seals.</p>

CANTERBURY</h3>

<p><i>Arms.</i>&mdash;Impaled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury (born 29th October 1562,
died 4th August 1633), was a native of Guildford, and took orders in 1585,
afterwards becoming a tutor at Oxford, where he was also a Fellow of
Balliol. He was a strong Puritan and a popular preacher at St. Mary's.</p>

<p>In 1597, Abbot was elected Master of University College, and in 1599<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he became Dean of Winchester and also Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Oxford. He wrote several treatises on the religious questions of his
time, and enjoyed the personal esteem of James I., who thought very
highly of him as a theologian and as a politician.</p>

<p>The King's favour showed in the rapid promotion of Dr. Abbot. In
1609 he was consecrated Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and later in
the same year he was translated to London. In the next year, on the
death of Archbishop Bancroft, Abbot was made Archbishop of Canterbury.
Dr. Abbot had no sinecure in his Archbishopric, and his many enemies
and the troubled state of theological matters generally left him but little
peace. In 1621, when shooting with a crossbow at a buck, he accidentally
killed a gamekeeper, and this not only preyed much upon his mind, but
it also offered a handle for his detractors, especially those among the clergy,
many of whom held that homicide rendered him unfit for his high position.</p>

<p>On the death of James I. Royal favour deserted the Archbishop, as
Charles I. never appears to have thought well of him. In 1627, on more
or less unjust pretexts, he suffered sequestration of his office, and a commission
was appointed to exercise the Archiepiscopal functions, and Abbot
retired to his native town, Guildford, where he died in 1633. Many of
his books remain in the Library at Lambeth Palace.</p></div>

<p>Anne Bullen, or Boleyn (born 1507, died 19th May 1536), was the
daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde, of Hever
Castle in Kent. She was maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon, Queen
of Henry VIII., and while acting in this capacity she attracted the attention
of the king, who decided that he would marry her if he could get rid of
Queen Catherine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently, after many difficulties, a divorce was arranged, and
Henry married Anne Bullen in 1532, and she was crowned Queen in
1533. Queen Elizabeth was her only child.</p>

<p>In 1536 the Queen was indicted of high treason, and on 19th May of
the same year she was beheaded. Some of the books bearing Queen
Anne Bullen's arms form part of the old Royal library in the British

<p>Anne of Denmark (born 12th December 1574, died 1619), Queen
Consort of James I., King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, was
the daughter of Frederick II., King of Denmark and Norway. The
alliance between the Danish Princess and James VI. of Scotland was not
agreeable to Queen Elizabeth, but in spite of her opposition the marriage
took place in 1589 at Upslo. In 1590 the king and queen returned to
Scotland, and in 1603, on the death of Queen Elizabeth, they came to
England.</p>

<p>Queen Anne was a great patron of Progresses, Pageants, and Masques,
and is said to have been a beautiful dancer. She was very extravagant, and
incurred much censure for running into debt, although her allowances
were very liberal. At one period Queen Anne was suspected of leanings
towards the Roman Catholic religion. She objected to the marriage,
ultimately of the greatest importance, of her daughter Elizabeth to
Frederick V., Elector Palatine of the Rhine, on the ground that his
position was not high enough, but she attended the marriage in 1612.</p>

<p>Several of her books are among the old Royal collection presented to
the British Museum in 1757.</p>

<p>Queen Anne (born 10th May 1655, died 1st August 1714) was the
second daughter of James II. and Anne Hyde, daughter of Edward Hyde,
first Earl of Clarendon. She succeeded her cousin, William III., on the
throne of England in 1702. Queen Anne was the last of the Stuart line
to occupy the throne of England.</p>

<p>The first coat-of-arms used by Queen Anne was the same as that
generally used by her predecessor, but without the arms of Nassau, that is
to say, first and fourth grand quarters, France and England quarterly;
second grand quarter, Scotland; and third grand quarter, Ireland.
In 1702 a notice was published in the <i>London Gazette</i> to the effect
that "wheresoever there shall be occasion to embroider, depict, grave, carve,
or paint Her Majesty's Royal Arms with a motto, this Motto following,
<i>viz</i>. <span class="smcap">Semper eadem</span>, is to be used" (23rd December). It will be remembered
that this motto had been previously used by Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Legislative Union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland took
place on Thursday, 6th March 1706, when the royal assent was given to
the Act. A change in the Royal coat-of-arms took place in consequence
of this Act, and for the remainder of the reign of Queen Anne (1706-1714)
the first and fourth grand quarters contained the coats of England and
Scotland impaled, in the manner used to denote husband and wife; the
second grand quarter, France; and the third grand quarter, Ireland.
Besides the coat-of-arms, the crowned initials and name of Queen Anne
were frequently stamped upon her books, and some of her book-stamps
appear to have been designed by foreigners.</p>

<p>Queen Anne's books came to the British Museum with the rest of the
old Royal Library of England in 1757.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Astle (born 22nd December 1735, died 1st December
1803) was a book collector and antiquary, and a native of Yoxall in
Staffordshire. In 1783 he was appointed Keeper of the Records in the
Tower of London, where his literary tastes stood him in good stead, and
he edited and indexed the treasures which were under his care with energy
and success; he was also a Trustee of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Astle wrote several important works; perhaps the most useful of them
are the Catalogue of the MSS. in the Cottonian Library, and a treatise
on the Origin and Progress of Writing. His printed books now belong to
the library of the Royal Institution, and his collection of Manuscripts
is kept at the British Museum. This important collection belonged successively
to the Marquis of Buckingham at Stowe, and then to the Earl of Ashburnham,
who sold it in 1883 to the Trustees of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Mr. Astle was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of
Antiquaries.</p></div>

<p>Francis Bacon (born 22nd January 1561, died 9th April 1626) was
a son of Sir Nicolas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Seals to Queen Elizabeth.
He went to Cambridge at the age of thirteen and studied law.</p>

<p>In 1595 he was elected Member of Parliament for Middlesex, but
presently fell upon evil times and, among other troubles, managed to
offend the Queen by some of his writings. James I., however, restored
him to Royal favour. In 1619 he became Lord Chancellor, and shortly
afterwards was created Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Albans. Bacon's
enemies presently prevailed against him again, and his own malpractices
with regard to various judicial matters gave them the opportunity of
ruining him. In spite of the king's favour and efforts in his behalf, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
1621 Bacon was ordered to pay a fine of &pound;40,000 for his misdeeds; he
was adjudged to be incapable of sitting in Parliament or to accept any
public office under the Crown, neither was he to be permitted to live
in any place where the Royal Court might be. He was, moreover, condemned
to be kept a prisoner in the Tower of London during the king's
pleasure.</p>

<p>In 1625, when Charles I. came to the throne of England, all these
judgments were reversed and Bacon was rehabilitated, but did not live
much longer to enjoy his honours.</p></div>

<p>Sir Orlando Bridgman (born 1606 (?), died 1674) was a distinguished
lawyer and legal author. He was the son of John Bridgman, Bishop of
Chester, and a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>In 1640 Bridgman was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan and
was Knighted. By submitting to Cromwell he escaped the penalties of
being a Royalist, and made himself of much importance as a lawyer during
the Commonwealth. At the Restoration Sir Orlando was received into
Royal favour in consideration of his former loyalty, and was given a
Baronetcy and made Chief Baron of the Exchequer. In 1660 he was
made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and in 1667 Lord Keeper of
the Great Seal. On occasions he acted as Speaker in the House of Lords.
Towards the end of his life he fell into some sort of disfavour, and lived

<p>William Cecil (born 13th September 1520, died 4th August 1598) was
the son of Richard Cecil, Master of the Robes to Henry VIII. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
educated at Cambridge, and soon showed a remarkable ability. After
Cambridge Cecil went to Gray's Inn and studied Law, and presently
came under the personal notice of Henry VIII., who at once took a strong
liking to him. At Court Cecil rapidly gained place and power, and
under the Protector Somerset he became Secretary of State. He steered
his way with some difficulty through the troubles accruing through the
claim of Lady Jane Grey to the throne, but managed to escape serious
misfortune, and was elected Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>At this time he also made himself useful to the Princess Elizabeth,
then holding a difficult political position, and when she became Queen
in 1558 she at once made Cecil a member of her Privy Council and
Secretary of State. In 1563 he was Speaker of the House of Commons.
Although not on friendly terms with the Earl of Leicester, and in a
position which gave cause to much envy, Cecil was able to retain
the confidence of Queen Elizabeth, who, in 1571, created him Baron
Burghley, and shortly afterwards a Knight of the Garter.</p>

<p>Lord Burghley seems to have had a considerable library, and most of
his books have upon them one or other of his beautiful stamps, sometimes
in gold and sometimes in blind.</p></div>

<p>Prince Charles (born 29th November 1600, died 30th January 1649)
was the second son of James I., and on the death of his brother Henry
became heir to the Crown. He was created Prince of Wales on 3rd
November 1616, and while holding this rank he often used some of his
brother's book-stamps, differentiating them, however, by the addition of his
initials "C. P.," and also by the substitution of gold for silver in places
where the latter metal had been used by Prince Henry, as, for instance, in
the case of the label of the eldest son and the feathers in the Prince of
Wales' plumes.</p>

<p>As Prince, Charles had a few small books bound for him in red
leather, the first instance of its use for English Royal bindings, and
towards the end of his reign again he had several fine bindings made for
him in the fine red morocco which was so largely used by Samuel Mearne
for Charles II. Whether Charles I.'s red bindings were made by Mearne
is doubtful, but it is possible that they were. They are quite plain except
for the fine coat-of-arms in the centre, and for delicate gold tooling, of
Mearne style, in the panels of the back. Charles I. was a patron of the
Arts and a man of cultured and literary tastes. The style of binding
that is generally associated with his name is of a better order than the
semis and heavy corners which marked the bindings made for James I.</p>

<p>Many of James I.'s stamps were, however, used by King Charles I., and
in a majority of cases it is only by the date of the printing of the book
that it is possible to say to which king the volume belonged. There is a
tendency for the corner-pieces to become less, and also a tendency to
substitute a more distinguished manner with regard to small gold toolings
than that of the formal symmetrical repetition so prevalent in the previous
reign.</p></div>

<p>Charles II. (born May 1630, died 6th February 1685) was the
elder son of Charles I. In 1660 Charles ascended the throne of
England, although his accession is sometimes counted from the date of
the death of Charles I., 30th January 1649. In Scotland it is always
so dated.</p>

<p>Samuel Mearne was appointed Royal Bookbinder to Charles II. in
June 1660, and he bound the greater number of the King's books in a
beautiful red morocco. On most of these bindings the King's initials
within a palm spray appear, and sometimes the edges of the leaves of
the books have designs painted upon them, only showing when the book
is open. Charles II. also used several of the book-stamps that had been
made for Charles I.</p>

<p>Mearne was one of the greatest bookbinders of any time, and apart
from the splendid work he did for Charles II., he executed numbers of
other bindings, many of which are inlaid and have the leather stained
and painted. He invented what is known as the "Cottage" design,
and his style and detail is often copied even at the present time.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Coke (born circ. 1699, died 20th April 1759) was the eldest
son of Edward Coke of Holkham in Norfolk. In 1725 Mr. Coke was
made a Knight of the Order of the Bath, and in 1728 he was created
Baron Lovel. In 1733 Lord Lovel was Postmaster-General, and in 1744
he was given a step in the Peerage and created Viscount Coke and Earl of
Leicester. In 1718 Lord Leicester married Lady Mary Tufton, daughter
of Thomas, Earl of Thanet. He left no heir, but the Earldom of Leicester
was revived in 1837 in the person of one of his collateral descendants.</p></div>

<p>The Commonwealth was established in England in 1649, and Oliver

death of Cromwell, the people of England felt that the Commonwealth
had lasted long enough, and in 1660 Charles II. returned among general
rejoicings. From a bookbinding point of view the period of the
Commonwealth was one of little interest, but on the Restoration, Samuel
Mearne raised the standard of English bookbinding to a very high level.</p></div>

<p>Robert Bruce Cotton (born 22nd January 1570, died 6th May 1631) was
the eldest son of Thomas Cotton of Connington, Huntingdon. At an early
age he began to collect manuscripts, especially English ones, and the dissolution
of the monasteries in the earlier half of the sixteenth century
afforded him excellent opportunity of acquiring invaluable examples. So
valuable was Cotton's collections, much of it containing official documents,
that twice it was sequestrated by the Government; some of it, however,
was restored to him. He was made a Baronet in 1611, having previously
received the honour of Knighthood. The part of the collection of
manuscripts which had been retained by the Government of the day was
eventually restored to his son Sir Thomas Cotton.</p>

<p>A grandson of Sir Robert, Sir John Cotton, desired to present the
collection to the Nation, together with Cotton House, with various conditions
as to name and safe custody, and after tedious negotiations the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
collection became National property and was deposited in Essex House,
Strand; in 1730 it was moved to Ashburnham House, in Little Dean's
Yard, Westminster, then the property of the Government, where also the
old Royal manuscripts were kept. In 1731 a fire occurred at Ashburnham
House, and a large number of manuscripts were burnt and many others
badly injured. The remainder were then stored in a dormitory at Westminster
School, and here they remained until they were transferred to the
British Museum in 1757.</p>

<p>The Cottonian collection of manuscripts is now kept in the Manuscript
Department at the British Museum; but there are numbers of printed
books as well that are widely distributed. A member of the Cotton
Family is always a Family Trustee of the British Museum. Sir Robert
Cotton wrote a large number of tracts, mainly political. The Cottonian
MSS. are curiously arranged under the names of the Roman Emperors.</p></div>

<p>Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode (born 23rd June 1730, died 5th April

<p>Clayton Cracherode was educated at Westminster and Christchurch,
Oxford, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries,
and a Trustee of the British Museum. He was ordained shortly
after leaving Oxford. On the death of his father, Mr. Cracherode became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
a rich man, and spent his fortune freely in collecting choice books,
bindings, drawings, prints, coins, and gems, always getting the finest
examples procurable.</p>

<p>Mr. Cracherode was an eccentric and shy recluse; he hardly ever left
London, and his life is said to have been embittered by the fact that he
was liable to act as King's Cup-bearer at a coronation, his manor at Great
Wymondley being held on that Tenure. The collections made by Mr.
Cracherode were all bequeathed to the British Museum except two
books, a Bible left to the Bishop of Durham, and a Homer to Cyril
Jackson, Dean of Christchurch, but both of these eventually were given
to the Museum Library. Several of Mr. Cracherode's books were bound
for him by Roger Payne, one of the greatest English bookbinders.</p></div>

<p>Kenelm Digby (born 11th July 1603, died 11th June 1665) was the
elder son of Sir Everard Digby, Knight, and Mary Mulsho, his wife. He
inherited large estates from his father in spite of the fact that much
of Sir Everard's property had been confiscated. Kenelm Digby was
educated at Oxford, at Gloucester Hall, near Worcester College. He
travelled much on the Continent, particularly in France and in Spain. In
1623 he was Knighted by James I. Quite early in life he had fallen in
love with Venetia, daughter of Sir Edward Stanley, and in 1625 he
married her.</p>

<p>In 1627 Digby fitted out and commanded a curious privateering
expedition, and captured several French, Dutch, Spanish, Flemish, and
Venetian ships, but his conduct was disavowed by the English government.
Digby was suspected of popish sympathies and suffered various terms
of imprisonment in consequence, but in 1643 he was allowed to leave
England for France, and for a time he made his home in Paris, a town to
which he had always been very partial, and he appears to have been well
received by Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby wrote a large number of books, religious, philosophical,
and scientific; he was a man of much imagination, and took delight in
inventing quack medicines. He possessed a large library; many of his
books were presented to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, others are said
to have been given to Louis XIV., and others again were scattered.
On some of the volumes the coat-of-arms of Digby alone occurs, but
in the majority of cases the coat-of-arms is quartered with various other
family coats, and has also the coat-of-arms of Venetia Stanley either
impaled or borne as an escutcheon of pretence. Many of Sir Kenelm's
books were bound in Paris.</p></div>

<p>Robert Dudley (born 24th June 1532, died 4th September 1588) was
a son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. In 1549 he married
Amy Robsart, who was killed at Cumnor Place in Berks in 1560. It
was supposed this was done in order to allow of a marriage between
Dudley and Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Lord Robert Dudley was a great favourite both of Edward VI., to
whom he had been a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Master of
the Buckhounds, and of Queen Elizabeth. He was for a time Member
of Parliament for Norfolk. With his father, the Duke of Northumberland,
Lord Robert conspired to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and for this he was sentenced to death in 1553, but shortly afterwards he
was pardoned and restored in blood. Under Elizabeth Dudley received
many honours. He was made Master of the Horse, Lord Steward of the
Household, and Knight of the Garter in 1559, and in 1564 Earl of
Leicester. In 1564 he was elected Chancellor of Oxford University, and
in 1575 he entertained the Queen at his beautiful home at Kenilworth.
Leicester was Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire and of other counties,
and his possessions were very great. He married a second time in 1573,
but left no heir.</p>

<p>The emblem of the ragged staff, or "Sable a staff raguly in bend
arg.," was used as a coat-of-arms by the ancient Earls of Warwick, and it
shows, as well as a bear, in the representations of the town of Warwick
held in the hands of figures in the "Rows Roll," written and illuminated
by John Rows of Warwick in the fifteenth century. The bear seems to
have been assumed as a cognizance by Earl Arthgallus, and may
either have been taken from the Warwick bear or as an allusion to his
name "Arth," in British meaning "Bear." The successive Earls of
Warwick used the bear and the ragged staff as a badge, and Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester, whose father, among other honours, was nineteenth
Earl of Warwick, used it as a crest. Lord Leicester used a chained
bear as his dexter supporter, and the ragged staff shows on one of his
many quarterings.</p></div>

<p>Prince Edward (born 12th October 1537, died 6th July 1553) was
the son of Henry VIII. and Queen Jane Seymour, his third wife. He
succeeded his father on the throne of England in 1547, and left the crown
by will to his cousin Lady Jane Grey, the result of which was that her
relatives endeavoured to place her upon the throne and she was beheaded
in 1554 by order of Queen Mary. Although the Prince of Wales's
plumes were used on the bindings made for Prince Edward, he never
was Prince of Wales. The majority of his bindings were made by
Thomas Berthelet, and they came to the British Museum with the rest
of the old Royal Library in 1757.</p>

<p>The supporters used by Edward VI. were the golden lion and the red
dragon, as they were used by Henry VIII. after 1528, but they do not

<p>Francis Henry Egerton (born 11th November 1756, died 11th
February 1829) was a son of John Egerton, Bishop of Durham. He was
educated at Eton and All Souls' College, Oxford, and was for a long time
Rector of Middle, Shropshire. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and
of the Society of Antiquaries. Mr. Egerton was a scholar and a book
lover, and wrote several books, mostly genealogical, a subject of which he
was very fond.</p>

<p>In 1823, on the death of his brother, Mr. Egerton became Earl of
Bridgwater, but he remained in Paris, where he had lived for some time.
With the Peerage Lord Bridgwater inherited a large fortune, and he
bequeathed a large portion of this in the endowment of Literature, one
result of which was the "Bridgwater Treatises." He also left a very
large collection of manuscripts and other treasures to the Trustees of the
British Museum, with property to allow of accessions.</p></div>

<p>The Princess Elizabeth (born 7th September 1533, died 24th March
1603) was the daughter of Henry VIII. and his second wife Anne Bullen.</p>

<p>In 1558 Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister Mary as Queen of England.
Queen Elizabeth loved magnificence of all kinds, and the bindings made
for her show a considerable range of style; several were sumptuously bound
in velvet with rich embroideries and pearls, some of these being made
by the workmen of Archbishop Parker; other velvet bindings were
stamped in gold, and had overlays of coloured satin. As Princess,
Elizabeth is supposed to have embroidered a few bindings; two of these
are now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and another is in the British
Museum. Others were in carved, engraved, or repouss&eacute; gold finely
enamelled, and numbers were in leather, both gold tooled and blind tooled;
some of the former were very likely bound for the Queen by the printer
John Day, who was the first English binder to use inlays of leather
coloured differently to the main part of the binding.</p>

<p>Small series of triple dots and small corner-pieces show for the first
time on small books bound for Queen Elizabeth towards the end of her
reign.</p>

<p>The supporters used by Queen Elizabeth were the golden lion and the
red dragon; they show on some of the beautiful painted bindings done for
the Queen, but not on any of the stamps. The Queen's portrait is sometimes
found stamped on her books.</p></div>

Fond of books, Lord Arundel made a large collection of them, and

of Bohemia; his acceptance of this dignity is said to have been largely due
to his wife's ambition. As Queen of Bohemia, Elizabeth's life was not
easy, and she was never popular at Prague, and in 1622 the Palatinate
was taken by the Duke of Bavaria. Her father, now James I. of England,
does not appear to have taken much interest in the Queen of Bohemia;
neither in turn did Charles I. In 1632 the King of Bohemia died, and

his life there were incessant quarrels between himself and his parents. In
1736 he married the Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha; it proved an
unhappy marriage.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales died in 1751, from the after-effects of an
accidental blow from a tennis ball, and nobody appears to have regretted
him. He left nine children, the eldest of whom, George, succeeded to
the throne of England on the death of his grandfather in 1760. The
Prince of Wales' books were generally bound in red morocco, with one or
other of his armorial stamps, some of which bear the label of the eldest
son, and others do not. But they all have the motto "<span class="smcap">Ich dien</span>," and
occasionally the initials "F. P." at the top on each side of the crest.</p></div>

<p>David Garrick (born 19th February 1716, died 20th January 1779)
was the son of an officer in the army, and of Huguenot descent from the
family of La Garrique of Bordeaux. Garrick took to the stage at an
early age, and after having unsuccessfully tried other means of making a
livelihood he eventually took to acting as a profession. He acted as an
amateur at St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell, and he wrote several plays. His
family did not approve of his becoming an actor, but his rapid success
ultimately reconciled them to it. His life-history is one of unvarying
triumphs, which, however, naturally made him many enemies; he left the
stage practically in 1762.</p>

<p>Garrick was a collector of treasures of all sorts, but particularly copies
of Early English plays, of which he made a very large and valuable collection.
These he bequeathed to the British Museum. He left a large
fortune, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p></div>

<p>George Lewis, Electoral Prince of Hanover (born 28th May 1660,
died 11th June 1727), was the eldest son of Sophia, youngest daughter of
the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I., and Ernest Augustus, Duke
of Brunswick-Lunenburg. In 1714 Prince George succeeded his cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Queen Anne, on the throne of England. He was then fifty-four years of
age, and firmly fixed in his German ideas; he never spoke English well,
and took every possible opportunity of revisiting his electoral dominions,
where he died in 1727.</p>

<p>George I. made an important change in the English coat-of-arms,
by including the quartered coat containing the Arms of the Royal
Dominions in Germany, Brunswick, Lunenburg, and Saxony. These
arms were used in the fourth quarter by George I., George II., and
George III. until 1801. After that date they were shown on an escutcheon
of pretence by George III., George IV., and William IV., at whose
death they were discontinued altogether.</p></div>

<p>George, Electoral Prince of Hanover, afterwards Prince of Wales
(born 30th October 1683, died 25th October 1760), was the only son
of George I., and succeeded his father on the throne of England in 1727.</p>

<p>In 1753 an Act was passed "For the purchase of the Museum or
Collection of Sir Hans Sloane and of the Harleian Collection of MSS.;
and for providing one General Repository for the better reception and more
convenient use of the said Collections, and of the Cottonian Library."
In 1757 King George II. added to these "Foundation Libraries" of the
British Museum, the old Royal Library of England, which had been
largely brought together by Henry, Prince of Wales. The old Royal
Library underwent several vicissitudes after the death of Prince Henry.
It was kept at St. James's Palace. When it was at length incorporated
with the Sloane and Cotton collections it numbered altogether about
fifteen thousand volumes, manuscripts, and printed books.</p>

<p>On 2nd September 1705, Prince George, then Electoral Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Hanover, married Wilhelmina Caroline (born 1st March 1683, died 20th
November 1737), the eldest daughter of John Frederick, Margrave of
Brandenburg-Anspach. Queen Caroline made herself as important in
Court and political affairs as she had already done as Princess, and allied
herself strongly with Sir Robert Walpole, then Minister of State, and
her power became very great, as the King gave way to her wishes almost
invariably. Both George II. and Queen Caroline disliked their eldest son
Frederick. During the King's several absences in Hanover, Queen
Caroline acted as Regent, to the great annoyance of the Prince of Wales.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George III. (born 4th June 1738, died 29th January 1820) was the
eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and grandson of George II. He
succeeded to the throne in 1760.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<p>The troubles in Ireland ended, for a time, in the Legislative Union in
1801. During the latter part of his reign George III. became insane
and the Prince of Wales was appointed Regent. Almost as soon as
George III. succeeded to the throne he began collecting books, no
doubt to a great extent induced to do so because of the fact that
George II. had practically denuded the Royal Libraries of their treasures
in 1757, but in many ways he possessed the true collector's instinct.
The Royal Librarian was Sir Frederick Barnard, K.C.H., who travelled
about the Continent seeking early editions and desirable books generally,
under the advice of Dr. Samuel Johnson. Besides the books collected
abroad by Sir Frederick, large numbers were acquired in England,
among these the entire library of Joseph Smith, British Consul at Venice.
Sir Frederick Barnard did not neglect the sale-room, and he acquired
especially valuable additions to the Royal Library at the sales of the
important libraries of James West, John Ratcliffe, and Richard Farmer,
all of which took place about the same time.</p>

<p>The library collected by George III. is now housed in the beautiful
room known as the "King's Library" in the British Museum. All the
books have one or other of the many book-stamps used by the King
impressed upon them, either on the sides or on the back. The estimated
number of volumes in the library at the time of its acquisition by the
British Museum was about eighty-four thousand, as well as a very
large collection of charts, maps, and drawings, and several manuscripts.
The books in the King's Library are in splendid condition, and among
them are numbers of precious bindings, especially later English, Scottish,
and Irish. Several of the Royal books were bound by Charles
Kalthoeber, a German binder who copied the style and stamps used by
Roger Payne.</p>

<p>The coat-of-arms used by George III. in the early part of his reign
was the same as that used by his predecessor, viz. first quarter, England
and Scotland impaled; second quarter, France; third quarter, Ireland; and
fourth quarter, Brunswick impaling Lunenburg, in the base point Saxony,
and an escutcheon of pretence bearing the crown of Charlemagne, as a
badge of the office of High Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. This
coat was used until 1801.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1801, a Proclamation was issued by the King
regarding the Legislative Union with Ireland, and certain armorial changes
are noted. The first is that in future the title of the King is to be "of Great
Britain and Ireland King," instead of as heretofore, "King of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Britain, France, and Ireland." Next the arms "shall be Quarterly: first
and fourth England; second Scotland; third Ireland; and it is our Will
and Pleasure that there shall be borne therewith on an escutcheon of
pretence, the arms of Our Dominions in Germany, ensigned with the
electoral Bonnet." So that now the fourth quarter, as used by George I.
and George II., is moved up, and shown on the escutcheon of pretence in
the centre of the shield.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the Fleurs-de-lys of France are now left out of
the English coat-of-arms, as well as the title of King of France. The
arms of France had been used in the English coat-of-arms since their
adoption, with the motto "<span class="smcap">Dieu et mon Droit</span>," by Edward III. in
1341, when he claimed the throne of France by right of his mother
Isabella, only surviving child of Philippe IV. From that time until 6th
March 1706, when Queen Anne changed the first quarter of the English
coat, the French Fleurs-de-lys had held the place of honour. Although
the French coat was discarded in 1801, the motto which alluded to the
same claim to the French throne has been retained and is still used.
The Fleurs-de-lys of France were at first sem&eacute;es, but Charles VI. of
France reduced them to three, and a corresponding change was presently
made in the English coat.</p>

<p>In 1816 the electorate of Hanover was given the rank of a kingdom, so
that the electoral bonnet no longer properly represented the dignity. On
8th June 1816, a notice was given in the London <i>Gazette</i> that his Majesty
was in future "King of Hanover," and that a corresponding alteration is
to be made in the Royal arms, and it is ordered that, "instead of the arms
of His Majesty's Dominions in Germany, ensigned with the electoral
bonnet, as directed by His Majesty's Proclamation above mentioned, there
shall henceforth be used and borne with the arms or ensigns armorial of
His Majesty's said United Kingdom, on an escutcheon of pretence, the
arms of His Majesty's Dominions in Germany, ensigned with the
Hanoverian Royal Crown."</p>

<p>The Royal title <i>Britanniarum Rex</i>, "King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland," without the Ducal titles of the Royal
Dominions in Germany, which had been used by George I. and
George II., first appears on the Fifth Great Seal of George III., used from
1st August 1815 to 17th September 1821.</p></div>

<h3>GEORGE IV., KING OF THE BRITAINS</h3>

<p>The coat-of-arms of George IV. was the same as
the last used by George III., namely 1st and 4th,
England; 2nd, Scotland; 3rd, Ireland; with the arms
of the Royal Dominions in Germany on an escutcheon
of pretence, ensigned with the Royal Crown of Hanover.</p>

<p>Several of the older book-stamps of George III.
were, however, frequently used by George IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George IV. used the same coat-of-arms as the last one of George III.,
that is to say, first and fourth grand quarters, England; second grand
quarter, Scotland; and third grand quarter, Ireland; on an escutcheon
of pretence the arms of the Dominions of the Crown in Germany,
ensigned with the Hanoverian Royal Crown.</p>

<p>When George IV. inherited the large library made by his father,
he very soon found that it was a very costly and troublesome legacy,
and at one time he was inclined to sell it to the Emperor, Alexander I.
of Russia. This idea, however, was very displeasing to English feeling,
and the Premier, Lord Liverpool, was able to convince the King that
any such sale would be highly unpopular. After considerable trouble
the matter was amicably arranged, and Ministers were able to satisfy
the King by means of a fund called "Droits of Admiralty," which they
could dispose of without troubling Parliament. The King then wrote a
letter, 15th January 1823, to Lord Liverpool, in which he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King, my late revered and excellent father, having formed
during a long series of years, a most valuable and extensive Library, I
have resolved to present this collection to the British Nation."</p>

<p>The library was consequently removed from Buckingham House to the
British Museum in 1828, and arranged in the beautiful room built for it.
In this room the books are kept by themselves, apart from the rest of the
library. It is probable that some idea of the ultimate destination of this
library existed as long ago as 1791, as in that year a German preacher,
Frederick Wendeborn, wrote that the books in the King's private library, "it

<p>John Gilbert (born circ. 1693, died 9th August 1761) was a son of
John Gilbert, Prebendary of Exeter. He was educated at Oxford, and
ordained about 1718.</p>

<p>In 1722 Gilbert succeeded to his father's Prebendal stall at Exeter,
and two years later he was made Dean. In 1726 Dr. Gilbert was
consecrated Bishop of Llandaff, and was afterwards translated to Salisbury.
In 1757 he became Archbishop of York. Gilbert was not a man
of much learning, and his preferment in the Church is remarkable as
being due more to influence than character. He published several
sermons.</p></div>

<p>George Granville Leveson-Gower (born 9th January 1758, died

George was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Gower during
his father's lifetime, and succeeded to the Marquisate in 1803.</p>

<p>The Marquis was a Member of the Privy Council and a Knight of
the Garter, and in 1833 he was created Duke of Sutherland. The
Earldom of Sutherland came into the Gower family by right of Elizabeth,
Countess of Sutherland in her own right, who married the Duke in
1785. It is said to be the most ancient Earldom in North Britain, and
to date back as far as 1057. The Duke's successors all used a quartering
on their coat-of-arms for this ancient Earldom, namely, gu., 3 mullets
or, within a bordure of the last, charged with a double tressure, flory
counterflory of the field.</p></div>

In 1780 Grenville was Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire, and
interested himself much in political matters. In 1790 he was Member
for Aldborough, and in 1794 he was Minister Extraordinary at Vienna.
His younger brother William, Baron Grenville, was Premier in 1806.</p>

<p>Grenville was a Member of the Privy Council, and in 1799 Ambassador
to Berlin, and was the last person to hold the office of Chief-Justice in
Eyre south of Trent. He was for a time First Lord of the Admiralty.
In 1818 Grenville left public life. He was always an eager collector of
fine books, and bequeathed his magnificent library to the nation. It is
now kept at the British Museum, of which Mr. Grenville was a Trustee,
in a room especially kept for it, and known as the Grenville Room.</p>

<p>Among the Grenville books are still a few fine old bindings, but the
majority have been rebound by George Lewis, one of the most eminent of
the later English trade binders.</p></div>

The coat shown on a lozenge is that of a lady of the Gulston family,

<p>Robert Harley (born 5th December 1661, died 21st May 1724)
was the son of Sir Edward Harley of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire.
Robert Harley was Member of Parliament for Tregony, and afterwards
for New Radnor, and was distinguished for his knowledge of finance. In
1701 he became Speaker of the House of Commons, and had a considerable
share in the passing of the Act for the Protestant succession to the Throne
of England.</p>

<p>In 1704, Mr. Speaker Harley became a Member of the Privy Council,
and also was made one of the Principal Secretaries of State. Owing to
various jealousies and plots against him, Harley resigned office in 1707.
In 1710 he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer; in 1711 he was
nearly assassinated by Antoine de Guiscard, a French adventurer, and his
escape increased his popularity, and he was created Earl of Oxford, and
Lord High Treasurer, an office he held until 1714.</p>

<p>In 1715 Lord Oxford was impeached for betrayal of duty and other
matters, twenty-two articles in all, and in 1717 he was acquitted after a
long trial.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<p>Through all his many political troubles, Harley continued the collection
of manuscripts, which was his dearest hobby. He brought together many
of the most famous collections, among them those of Sir Thomas Smith,
Sir Symonds D'Ewes, and the Earl of Stamford. In the Harleian Library
were about six thousand volumes of manuscripts, as well as about fifteen
thousand separate rolls and charters, and this collection was largely added
to by the second Earl. The entire collection was purchased by Parliament
in 1753, and is now in the British Museum. The printed books
were dispersed.</p>

<p>Many of the Harleian books were bound, generally in red morocco, by
Thomas Eliot and Christopher Chapman, with broad, gold-tooled borderings,
and this style is known as the "Harleian." Several of Lord Oxford's
favourite books have a facsimile signature "Robert Harley," impressed inside
on the paper in gold. A member of the Harley family always holds one
of the six family trusteeships of the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>Henry Tudor (born 26th June 1456, died 1509) was the son of Edmund
Tudor, Earl of Richmond, and Margaret Beaufort. In 1486 the Earl of
Richmond married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV., the
first King of the Yorkist line, and as the Earl himself represented the
Lancastrian line, by way of Catherine Swinford, this marriage united
the two houses of York and Lancaster, and gave rise to the beautiful
Tudor badge of the Red and White Rose. The two colours are shown
sometimes per pale, sometimes quartered, or there may be simple rows
of alternate petals, or, as is most usual, the inner petals are all white and
the outer petals all red; the centre is always gold, and the little leaves
between the outer petals, if showing at all, are green. The portcullis and
gateway, also commonly used as badges by our Sovereigns until the time
of Charles I., are both used as emblems of the De Beaufort alliance.
The portcullis is or, nailed az., chained and ringed of the first.</p>

<p>The Earl of Richmond defeated Richard III. at the battle of Bosworth
Field in 1485, and the king was killed. Henry VII. was crowned king
on the battlefield. He possessed a considerable number of manuscripts,
and also a small library of printed books, which, as far as is known, were
bound in velvet. Judging from the leather binding in Westminster Abbey
Library, Henry also had some commoner books stamped with his coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>Several bindings that were made for Henry VII. still exist; they are
either at the Record Office, the Library of Westminster Abbey, or the
British Museum, and are all bound in the same way. The binding is of
red velvet, beautifully bossed with silver or other metal; the bosses are
ornamented with the Royal coat-of-arms, with the red dragon of
Cadwallader as a dexter supporter, and the white greyhound of the Nevills,
or, when used by Henry VII., of the De Beauforts, as sinister supporter.</p>

<p>But before using the dragon and greyhound Henry VII. had used
two white lions. A white lion was the badge of the Earls of March, who
were distantly connected with the King.</p>

<p>The coat-of-arms used by Henry VII., <i>i.e.</i> France and England
quarterly, was the same as had been used by all the English kings since
Henry IV. in 1408, when the fleurs-de-lys sem&eacute;es, which had been
hitherto used, were reduced to three, in accordance with the change made
in the French coat by Charles VI., King of France.</p></div>

<p>Prince Henry (born 28th June 1491, died 28th January 1547) was the
second son of Henry VII., and in 1509 succeeded his father on the throne
of England. Henry VIII. always lived in much luxury and loved finery
and splendour, and to a certain extent this feeling shows in the many
beautiful bindings which were made for him. The King was certainly
fond of his books, and he had several of them beautifully bound in velvet
and embroidered with pearls and inlays of coloured silks and satins, finished
with gold thread. Others are of gold, richly worked and enamelled.</p>

<p>For his Queens also several fine bindings were made; these, however,
were generally armorial panel stamps, impressed without gold. He married
six times. For Catherine of Aragon bindings were made which still exist,
for Anne Bullen and Catherine Parr, the same, but for Jane Seymour,
Anne of Cleves, or Katherine Howard I know of no bindings recorded or
in existence. Katherine Parr is said to have herself embroidered a
beautiful armorial velvet-bound copy of Petrarch with her own arms, and
at the Bodleian Library at Oxford there is a book said to have been
embroidered for her by the Princess Elizabeth, on which are the initials
"K. P."</p>

<p>Thomas Berthelet, the first English bookbinder to use gold tooling was
made Royal Printer and Bookbinder to Henry VIII. in 1530, and he
bound the greater number of the Royal books in leather, velvet, or satin.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. used the same coat-of-arms and supporters as his father,
namely, the red dragon of Cadwallader as a dexter supporter and the white
greyhound of the Nevills as a sinister supporter, until 1528, when he
adopted a golden lion rampant royally crowned as his dexter supporter, and
moved the dragon to the sinister side, leaving out the greyhound altogether.
This change, however, does not, as far as I know, show on any book, but
it can be seen on the gold coins of the period, and also on a sculptured
compartment at Caerhays, is common at the house of a member of the
Trevanion family, and again on the keystone of the ceiling over the organ-loft
at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and here, moreover, the date 1528 is
also given.</p></div>

<p>Henry Benedict (born 5th March 1725, died 13th July 1807) was the
second son of James Francis Edward, called the Chevalier St. George,
son of James II., King of England, and Mary of Modena, who married
Mary Clementina, daughter of James Sobieski, in 1719.</p>

<p>Prince Henry, who occasionally used the Royal Crown of England
over his coat-of-arms, is called sometimes Henry IX., King of England.
He entered the Romish Church as a priest at an early age, and in 1747 he
was made a Cardinal by Benedict XIV., and held several Bishoprics and
the Archbishopric of Corinth, but was usually known as Cardinal York.
He assumed certain airs of dignity abroad in consequence of his Royal
ancestry and claims, and in 1788, on the death of his elder brother, he had
a medal made and inscribed "<span class="smcap">Henricus nonus magnae britanniae
rex</span>."</p>

<p>The Cardinal lived almost always abroad, and suffered much by loss of
revenue caused by the French Revolution; he had to part with much of
his private property, jewels, and plate. At this juncture George III.
generously assisted Cardinal York, and made him a handsome allowance,
in gratitude for which His Eminence bequeathed to the Prince of
Wales, afterwards George IV., many of the Crown Jewels which James
II. had taken with him to France. Some of the most important of these
stones now adorn the English Imperial Crown. The Cardinal had a large
library, and several of his books are at Windsor and at the British
Museum. The majority of these are in leather, but some are embroidered.</p></div>

<p>Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (born 19th February 1594, died
6th November 1612), was the eldest son of James I., and from his
childhood showed studious and literary inclinations, as well as sporting
tastes. In 1609 he purchased the library of John, Lord Lumley, a great
part of which had previously belonged to his father-in-law, Henry Fitz-Alan,
Earl of Arundel, and another large proportion to Thomas Cranmer,
Archbishop of Canterbury. He also acquired a number of books which
had belonged to a Welshman, John Maurice or Morris.</p>

<p>On the Prince's death his library became the property of James I., and
it was added to the existing Royal Library, then under the care of Patrick
Young.</p>

<p>Prince Henry had his books bound in calf, and probably destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
numbers of valuable old bindings which were originally used. The new
bindings were ornamented with stamps bearing the Prince's coat-of-arms,
without supporters, and others showing a lion rampant, with princely
coronet; a Tudor rose, with princely coronet; a fleur-de-lys, and two
stamps, with slight variations, of the Prince of Wales's plume of three
ostrich feathers. These latter stamps are normally used as corner-pieces,
but they also show now and then as centres. Smaller corner stamps
are found showing coroneted Tudor roses, coroneted thistles, coroneted
fleurs-de-lys, and Prince of Wales's feathers in gold. On the panels of
the backs of Prince Henry's books are found small stamps of a lion
rampant, with princely coronet; a unicorn rampant; a Tudor rose; a
portcullis, sometimes chained, and a Royal Crown. These are arranged
in various combinations.</p>

<p>The greater number of Prince Henry's bindings are simple, having
the coat-of-arms in the centre and the badges in the corners, but several
are very handsomely ornamented with accessory gold tooling. The label
shown on Prince Henry's coat-of-arms is the cadency mark of the eldest
son; it is generally impressed in silver, as it ought always to be. The
feathers in the Prince of Wales's plume are always impressed in silver,
which has now oxidised black. Prince Henry's library came to the British
Museum with the rest of the Old Royal Library of England in 1757.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Howard (born c. 1585, died 24th September 1646) was the

James I. restored his father's titles to Thomas Howard, but not the
property, much of which, however, he subsequently purchased; and in

of Henry Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, who had also been a great book
collector, and whose library had been largely acquired by Henry, Prince

he acquired marbles, coins, gems, and pictures. Among the more
notable of the collections of manuscripts purchased by Lord Arundel
was that made by the Pirckheimer family of N&uuml;remberg. The manuscripts
were for some time kept at Arundel House, where they suffered
much from neglect, and in 1666 most of them were given to the Royal
Society and others to the Heralds' College.</p>

<p>In 1831 the Arundelia MSS. in the Royal Society's library were
transferred, by arrangement, to the British Museum. Lord Arundel was
made a Knight of the Garter in 1611; in 1616 he became a Member
of the Privy Council; and in 1621 he was restored to his hereditary post
of Earl Marshal. He was also High Steward of England.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>James Stuart (born 19th June 1566, died 27th March 1625) was the
son of Mary, Queen of Scotland, and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. He
was great-grandson of the Princess Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry
VII., who had married James IV., King of Scotland, in 1502, and by right
of this descent James came into the line of succession of the English throne.
On the dethronement of Queen Mary in 1569, under the Regency of
the Earl of Murray, James became King of Scotland under the title of
James VI., and reigned for thirty-four years until the death of his cousin,
Queen Elizabeth, in 1603, when he inherited the English crown and
came to England as James I.</p>

<p>On the accession of James I., a greater change took place in the
English Royal coat-of-arms than had ever occurred before. The old coat,
France and England quarterly, which had practically been in use ever since
the time of Edward III., now became only a quartering, and was shown
in the first and fourth quarters, then in the second quarter James put the
ancient coat-of-arms of Scotland, or, a lion rampant, within a double tressure
flory counterflory gu.</p>

<p>The lion appears for the first time on the shield of Alexander II., and
it is supposed to have been derived from the ancestors of the Scottish
kings, the Earls of Northumberland and of Huntingdon, whose device it
was. The tressure is also of doubtful origin, and is also very ancient;
it is popularly supposed to have been given by Charlemagne in recognition
of a league between that monarch and Achaius, King of Scotland.
The double tressure is presumed to indicate that there were two
treaties.</p>

<p>In the third quarter is the coat-of-arms of Ireland, az., a harp or,
stringed arg. This harp appears on an illuminated manuscript that
belonged to Elizabeth, and is said to have been granted to Ireland by
Henry VIII. as a mark of his admiration for the musical qualities of the
Irish. It also is used as a badge on Irish coins of and after 1526, and this
single harp was increased to three in similar coins made during Elizabeth's
reign. The harp was sacred to Apollo Grian or Beal, an ancient Irish
deity. Irish silver groats of 1478 show the device of three crowns in pale,
and this was probably the coat-of-arms of Ireland at that time, and before
that, in 1422, a single crown is found as a badge.</p>

<p>It is curious to note the strong tendency of single devices or badges to
merge into threes. It occurs first in the case of the single crown, which
presently gets tripled, then the single harp does the same, and the three
castles, the arms of Dublin, very likely began as one.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<p>James I. made one more important change; he substituted one of the
Scottish unicorn supporters for the red dragon of Cadwallader, used as a
dexter supporter by Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth.
The ancient Scottish supporters were two unicorns arg., armed, maned,
and unguled, gorged with a princely coronet and chained or. The origin
of the unicorn supporters is lost, but the creature is generally considered to
be an emblem of purity and of freedom; the horn, moreover, was credited
with medical powers as a remedy against poisons. The idea of an animal
bearing a single horn arose probably from the horn of the narwhal, which
has diagonal striations upon it resembling those generally shown on the
horn of a unicorn, and certainly does not look like the tooth of a fish.
On the other hand cups made of rhinoceros horn are credited with the
same magical powers as that of the unicorn. The chain attached to a
princely coronet on the neck of the unicorn is not easy to explain; it is
said that it alludes to an early king of Scotland, who, as a young man,
accidentally killed his father, and bore the chain ever afterwards on his
supporters as a sign of grief.</p>

<p>The lion and the unicorn have remained ever since the time of James
I. as the supporters of the English Royal coat-of-arms, without any change
whatever.</p>

<p>In Scotland James VI. had John Gibson for his bookbinder. He was
appointed under the Privy Seal, and was "Our Soverane Lordis Buikbinder,"
but there is no binding left that can with certainty be attributed to him.
On James's advent to England John and Roger Norton and Robert
and Christopher Barker were made Royal binders and printers, and in
1604 John and Abraham Bateman were made "Bookbinders to the
King."</p>

<p>The many fine armorial bindings which were used by James I. were
probably made by one or other of these binders, but for the present no
signed binding has been found, so the authorship of any one of them is
only conjectural.</p>

<p>The main characteristic of the finer bindings made for James I. is the
form of ornamentation known as a semis, that is to say, a powdering all
over the field of small stamps arranged symmetrically near together. The
commonest of these small stamps show stars, flaming hearts, ermine spots,
roses, thistles, pineapples, tridents, fleurs-de-lys, and lions, but there are
several others. Another characteristic is the presence of large corner
stamps. These are cut in arabesque designs, and many of them are very
handsome. The idea of corner ornamentation of this sort began late in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Queen Elizabeth's reign, but it did not reach its highest excellence in
stamp form until well into the reign of James I.</p>

<p>James I. was the first sovereign to have his books mainly bound in
morocco, and this leather is found in most quiet colours&mdash;greens and
browns and blues, but not red. Several beautiful volumes are also bound
in vellum, and others in velvet and satin. The Jacobean period was a
decorative one, but not one of the highest level of the art of bookbinding.
The greater number of James I.'s books came to the British Museum
by gift of George II. in 1757, with the rest of the Old Royal Library of
England.</p></div>

<p>James, Duke of York (born 14th October 1633, died 16th September
1701), was the second son of Charles I. He succeeded his brother Charles
II. in 1685. James II. had a short and troubled reign, chiefly because
he had Roman Catholic tendencies, and ultimately joined that faith. The
feeling in favour of Protestantism in England was very determined, and
the nation ultimately invited William, Prince of Orange, who had married
James's elder daughter Mary and was a strong Protestant, to come and
accept the throne. This he did, and in 1689 James was deposed and
William became King in his stead.</p>

<p>James fled to France where he lived for the rest of his life, and the
book-stamps that he had made at this time do not include the French
coat. He was known as the Duke of York, but nevertheless his book-stamps
show a Royal Crown. James's second wife, Mary of Modena, was
a Roman Catholic and strongly influenced his views. He died at St.
Germains, Paris, at the age of seventy.</p></div>

Prince James, who is known as the Old Pretender in distinction to
his son Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, is also known as the
Chevalier St. George. His history is an unhappy one from his birth.
On his father's death in 1701 at St. Germains he was proclaimed James
III. of England and VIII. of Scotland, but by the Act of Settlement made
in the same year the Stuarts were cut out of the succession to the English
throne.</p>

<p>The Chevalier St. George spent his life in fruitless endeavours to make
good his claim to the English throne. His character appears to have been
wanting in most of the qualities that make for success, and towards the
latter part of his life his misfortunes so preyed upon him that he gave way
to unworthy dissipations.</p></div>

Ann Read of Brookland. Mr. Kemp was educated at Cambridge, and
in 1811 he represented Lewes in the House of Commons. He sold his
castles at Lewes and at Hurstmonceaux and built largely near Brighton,
where the district known as Kemp Town was founded by him. He
spent all his fortune in this speculation, which, however, in time became
of great value.</p>

<p>The family of Kemp or Kempe is one of great antiquity in Kent.
John Kempe, Archbishop of Canterbury in the fifteenth century, and his

<p>John Ker (born 23rd April 1740, died 19th March 1804) was the
elder son of Robert Ker, second Duke of Roxburghe. He succeeded his
father in the title in 1755. The Duke brought together a splendid
library, among which was the special collection of ballads which are now
known by his name. The ballads were at first collected by Robert
Harley, and they were largely added to by a Mr. West and by Major
T. Pearson, and after the entire collection had been purchased by the
Duke of Roxburghe he continued adding to it himself.</p>

<p>In 1812 the Duke's library was sold and the books widely scattered;
the ballads, however, in 1845 were acquired for the British Museum at
the sale of the books of Mr. B. H. Bright. The Duke of Roxburghe
was a Knight of the Garter, and also a Knight of the Thistle. He was a
Lord of the Bedchamber and a Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>The Kinnears were well known as a family of bankers, and they

<p>William Laud (born 7th October 1573, died 10th January 1645) was
the son of William Laud of Reading. After leaving Reading he went to
Oxford and entered the Church, and quickly came into notice as a theologian.
He was supposed to favour Romish doctrines. After enjoying several
minor appointments, Laud was made Dean of Gloucester in 1616, and by
this time he was high in the favour of James I., who in 1621 promoted
him to the Bishopric of St. David's.</p>

<p>Under Charles I. Laud acquired still more importance. In 1626 he
was made Dean of the Chapel Royal, and next year a member of the Privy
Council, and in 1628 he became Bishop of London. In 1629 Laud was
Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and in 1633 he was made Archbishop
of Canterbury. Archbishop Laud was impeached for treason in
1641; he underwent his trial in 1644, and an ordinance of attainder was
passed in the next year. Although Laud had in his possession a pardon
from the king, he was beheaded on Tower Hill in 1645. He wrote
a large number of books, mainly theological or historical. Several of his
books are in the library at Lambeth Palace, and others are in the British
Museum.</p></div>

proclaimed King of Scotland on the day of his marriage.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
<p>Lord Darnley was murdered in 1567, and Queen Mary dethroned in
favour of her son, James VI., and in the same year she married John
Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, who is supposed to have been Darnley's
murderer. Troubles multiplied round the unfortunate queen. Her husband
had to take refuge abroad, and she herself was made a prisoner and shut
up at Loch Leven. Queen Mary asked Queen Elizabeth's help in the
discords which became incessant in Scotland, and at last Mary was induced
to put herself in her rival's power, and took refuge at Carlisle.</p>

<p>The end was that after a long imprisonment in England she was tried,
condemned, and beheaded at Fotheringay in 1587, the plea being that she
had conspired against Queen Elizabeth's life.</p>

<p>Queen Mary was very intellectual and a notable linguist. Many of
her books are bound in black and have black edges. This is supposed to
have been intended as a mark of mourning for her first husband. Mary's
only son, James VI., succeeded to the throne of England on the death
of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, his title in England being James I.</p></div>

<p>Mary Beatrice of Modena (born 5th October 1658, died 7th May
1718) was a daughter of Alphonso IV., D'Este, Duke of Modena. She
was a strong Roman Catholic. In 1673 she married James, Duke of
York, whom she presently converted to the Roman Catholic religion, and
when she became queen in 1685, her influence over the king continued
to be very great. There were many disquieting rumours about the birth
of the Prince of Wales, and Queen Mary was never liked in England.
She seems, however, to have been a devoted and affectionate wife.</p>

<p>Her trouble culminated about 1688, when she fled to France with her
little son, and was well and honourably received by Louis XIV. James
II. presently joined her at the Palace of St. Germain, which the French
king had put at his disposal on his deposition from the throne of England
in 1689. After James's death in 1701 Queen Mary continued to live at
St. Germain, and remained there for the rest of her life.</p></div>

<p>Mary Tudor (born 1497, died 23rd June 1534) was the youngest
daughter of Henry VII. At an early age she was enamoured of Charles
Brandon, afterwards Duke of Suffolk. Henry VIII., however, decided
that her marriage with Louis XII. of France was more expedient, and in
1514 she became his Queen. Next year she was left a widow, and almost
immediately she married the Duke of Suffolk abroad, and the marriage

St. Mary's Church in the High Street at Oxford, and attracted Her Majesty's
attention by his eloquence and his handsome appearance. He was made
a Canon of Christchurch Cathedral in 1570, and Dean in 1576. In
1583 he was Dean of Durham. In 1595 he was consecrated Bishop of
Durham, and in 1606 Archbishop of York. Archbishop Matthew took a
prominent part in the political as well as the theological affairs of his time.
Lady Arabella Stuart was imprisoned in his house, and she escaped from it

<p>John Montagu (born circ. 1688, died 6th July 1749) was the son of
Ralph Montagu, Duke of Montagu, whom he succeeded in 1709. At
the coronation of George I. the Duke of Montagu was High Constable,
and he was Governor of St. Lucia and St. Vincent, both of which islands
were given to him by the king.</p>

<p>The Duke of Montagu carried the sceptre with the cross at the
coronation of George II., and in 1740 he was made Master-General of
the Ordnance. He raised a regiment of cavalry, known as "Montagu's
Carabineers." In 1719 he was made a Knight of the Garter, and in 1725
Grand Master of the Order of the Bath, and he also held several military
appointments. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal
College of Physicians.</p>

<p>The Duke's town residence, Montagu House, originally occupied the
site now covered by the British Museum, and at his death it was acquired
by the Government. Many alterations were carried out for the better
housing of the collections which were placed in it, and eventually it was
entirely rebuilt in a more convenient form. It had been originally built
for Ralph, the first Duke of Montagu. The Duke married Mary
Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, the great
General. Lady Mary Churchill's only brother having died as a boy, she
and her sisters became heraldic heiresses, so their coat-of-arms were borne
on an escutcheon of pretence in the centre of the coats-of-arms of their
respective husbands.</p></div>

brother.</p>

<p>Sir William was a Commissioner of Customs and of Accounts, a
Fellow and Vice-President of the Royal Society, a lawyer of much distinction,
and a Bencher and Treasurer of the Middle Temple. He was
author of a very useful compilation known as Musgrave's Obituary; it
gives reference to places where the various persons deceased are mentioned,
and also further particulars. The obituary was published by the Harleian
Society in 1899-1901.</p>

<p>Sir William Musgrave made large collections of manuscripts on the
subject of portrait-painting in England, and also concerning the history of
England. He bequeathed these manuscripts, as well as a considerable
number of printed books, to the British Museum, of which he was a
Trustee. He had already given several books to the library during his
lifetime, many of which contain an autograph note of the presentation.</p></div>

<p>Robert Naunton (born circ. 1563, died 27th March 1635) was the son of
Henry Naunton of Alderton. He was educated at Cambridge, where in
1594 he was elected Public Orator, and travelled largely on the Continent
for the purpose of studying politics. He was Member of Parliament for
Helston in 1606, then for Camelford and for Suffolk, and sat in three
Parliaments as Member for Cambridge. In 1614 he received the honour
of Knighthood, and in 1617 became Secretary of State, and afterwards
Master of the Court of Wards. Sir Robert was an earnest Protestant,
and the Catholics considered that he was too strongly opposed to their
interests. The latter part of his life was troubled, chiefly because he
was too free in expressing his own views as to matters of public interest.
Although he held several important official offices, he does not appear to
have been a man of much talent, but his management of the matters
entrusted to him was marked by strong common sense and trustworthiness.
He wrote several valuable books on travel, biography, and history.</p></div>

Abergavenny was Lord Lieutenant of Sussex, and in 1784 he was created
Earl of Abergavenny.</p>

<p>The use of the badges shown is not confined to any particular
earl, but had been generally used by the Nevill family for a long time.
The Red Rose of Lancaster was adopted as a badge by Richard Nevill,
Earl of Warwick, whose daughter Anne married Edward, Prince of
Wales, only son of Henry VI., the last of the Lancastrian Kings, in
1470. The Princess Anne afterwards married Richard III., the last of
the Yorkist Kings. The portcullis was used as a badge of descent from
the house of De Beaufort, and both badges are still used by the family
of Nevill.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Matthew Parker (born 6th August 1504, died 17th May 1575) was
educated at Cambridge, and in 1527 he took orders and became a Fellow
of his College, and quickly made a name as a powerful preacher. In
1537 he was made Chaplain to the King and a Prebendary of Ely. He
became Master of his old College, St. Benet's (Corpus Christi), in 1544.
In 1552 he was Dean of Lincoln, but on Mary's accession he lost that
and his other preferments on the ground of his being married.</p>

<p>During all Queen Mary's reign Dr. Parker kept himself well out of
the way, but when Elizabeth came to the throne he was sought out
and in 1559 consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, being the second
Protestant Archbishop of that See.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<p>Archbishop Parker concerned himself much with literature, and wrote
several valuable books. He had much to do with the Book of Common
Prayer, and also with the revisal of the then existing translation of the
Bible, the edition finally issued by him being known as the "Bishop's
Bible." He founded the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1572, and
bequeathed a large number of books and manuscripts to the University of
Cambridge and to his old College.</p>

<p>Archbishop Parker had a staff of workmen in his own house, part
of which was fully equipped for their use. His work <i>De Antiquitate
Britannicae Ecclesiae</i>, of which it is said no two copies are alike, as the
Archbishop made some alterations in the proofs every time they were
submitted to him, is said to have been printed at the Archbishop's press
by John Day. Some of his books are beautifully bound in embroidered
velvet, also supposed to have been done in his own house. In one of
his letters to Lord Burghley, he says that he has in his house "Paynters,
Lymners, Wryters, and Book-Bynders." It is possible that several of
the fine bindings made for Queen Elizabeth and for Lord Burghley
were really made in the Archbishop's workshop.</p></div>

<p>Samuel Pepys (born 23rd February 1632, died 26th May 1703) was
the son of John Pepys of Cottenham, in Cambridgeshire. He was
educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and became clerk of the
Acts of the Navy in 1660.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<p>In 1673 Mr. Pepys was Secretary to the Admiralty, and he introduced
several admirable reforms in the management of that office, which he
retained until 1689. He accompanied Lord Dartmouth to Tangier, and
made several expeditions to the Continent and about the coasts of England.</p>

<p>In 1690 he published his <i>Memoirs</i> concerning the navy of England,
a very important work. In 1684 Mr. Pepys was President of the Royal
Society. He left a considerable library to his old College at Cambridge,
manuscripts as well as printed books, and also several prints. Pepys kept
a curious <i>Diary</i> in cypher from 1659 to 1669. It has been deciphered and
published several times, but the best edition is that issued by Mr. H. B.
Wheatley in 1893.</p></div>

<p>Henry Percy (born April 1564, died 5th November 1632) was the son
of the eighth Earl of Northumberland and succeeded his father, who was
murdered in the Tower, in 1585. Lord Northumberland was fined and
imprisoned in the Tower in consequence of an alleged complicity in the
Gunpowder Plot. In 1593 he was made a Knight of the Garter, and in
1603 he was Captain of the Corps of Gentlemen Pensioners.</p>

<p>Northumberland was in distant remainder to the Crown of England,
and at one time it was probable that his claims might be strengthened
by a marriage with Lady Arabella Stuart, niece of Lord Darnley, and
great-granddaughter of Margaret, elder daughter of Henry VII., but the
negotiation came to nothing. The Earl was fond of scientific pursuits
and was known as "The Wizard Earl," and was a great smoker. The
badge of the silver crescent was used by the Percy family generally and
not exclusively by any particular member of it.</p></div>

<p>William Fitzmaurice Petty (born 1737, died 7th May 1805) was the
son of John, Earl of Shelburne. He was educated at Oxford, and then
entered the army, and fought at Campen and at Minden, eventually
becoming a general officer. He represented High Wycombe in
Parliament. In 1761, on the death of his father, William Petty became
Earl of Shelburne, and quickly made his mark in the House of Lords, and
became head of the Board of Trade. In 1766 he became a Secretary of
State for the Southern Department. On the death of Lord Rockingham
in 1782, Lord Shelburne succeeded as Premier, and held this position
until 1783. In 1784 Lord Shelburne was created Marquis of Lansdowne,
and he spent the remainder of his life at his beautiful Wiltshire seat of
Bowood.</p>

<p>About 1765 he began collecting books, particularly those concerning
history and politics. Among the books collected by Lord Shelburne were
several which had belonged to Sir Julius C&aelig;sar, and also many of Lord
Burghley's. Lord Lansdowne's manuscripts were acquired for the British
Museum by purchase after his death.</p></div>

<p>Edwin Sandys (born 9th December 1561, died October 1642) was the
sixth son of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York. He was educated at
Merchant Taylors' and Oxford, and in 1589 entered the Middle Temple
as a student. In 1586 Mr. Sandys represented Andover in Parliament,
and afterwards sat for Plympton. He wrote some books on religious
subjects during a visit to Paris. In 1603 he received the honour of
Knighthood, and was Member of Parliament for Stockbridge.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
<p>Sir Edwin Sandys was conspicuous in Parliament, and got into trouble
about his views as to the succession to the throne, and had to appear before
the Council, but nothing was done further than that he had to give security
for his appearance if wanted. He was an active member of the East India
Company, and the Sandys group of islands in the Somers Islands was
named after him. He also took a prominent part in the affairs of the
Virginia Company, of which he was elected Treasurer in 1619, in
succession to Sir Thomas Smythe. His administration, however, in the
long-run, was no better than that of his predecessor, and in 1621 he was
imprisoned in the Tower, but soon released.</p>

<p>Sir Edwin was returned to Parliament as Member for Sandwich, and
afterwards for Penrhyn, but soon afterwards left public life, and devoted
himself to his favourite East India Company. His political career was of
much interest and importance.</p></div>

the two professions being in his time curiously considered as one. As a
sailor he took part in the fight at Solebay in 1672 under the Duke of
York, and afterwards was Captain of the "Royal Catherine." As a soldier
Lord Mulgrave was Colonel of the Holland Regiment, Governor of Hull,
and commanded a force at Tangier. In 1674 he was made a Knight of
the Garter. He was a member of the Privy Council and Lord Chamberlain
of the Household. In 1694 he was made Marquis of Normandy, and in

<p>Hans Sloane (born 16th April 1660, died 11th January 1753) was the son
of Alexander Sloane, a Scotchman who settled in Ireland as receiver-general
of the estates of Lord Clanricarde.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
<p>When he was about eighteen Hans Sloane came to London to pursue
his studies, particularly medicine, chemistry, and botany. In botany he
became a great authority, and his botanical collections were of great
importance. In 1683 he went to France to continue his scientific studies,
and on his return to London he set up as a practising physician in
England.</p>

<p>In 1687 Dr. Sloane went to the West Indies as physician to Christopher
Monck, second Duke of Albemarle, who was Governor-General of the
West Indian Colonies, and during the voyage the doctor made valuable
collections, chiefly botanical, and also brought together a mass of material
for his future use as an author. Dr. Sloane's botanical collections were
largely increased by bequests from friends, particularly that of William
Courten in 1702. In 1693 Dr. Sloane was Secretary to the Royal
Society, and he was also Physician-in-Chief to George I., who in 1716
created him a Baronet. He was President of the College of Physicians
in 1719 and of the Royal Society in 1727. Sir Hans Sloane lived in a
house in Great Russell Street, and in 1741 he moved to more roomy
quarters at the Manor House, Chelsea, where his collections could be
better seen.</p>

<p>By his will Sir Hans Sloane bequeathed his natural history collections,
antiquities of all sorts, manuscripts, and printed books to the British
Nation, conditional on the payment to his family of &pound;20,000, and after
considerable negotiation the offer was accepted. In 1753 an Act (25th
George II., chap. 22) was passed "for the purchase of the Museum or
Collection of Sir Hans Sloane," and the collections were in time, with
others, removed to Montagu House, which was opened to the public in
1759. The Sloane family is represented among the Family Trustees of
the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>Joseph Smith (born circ. 1682, died 6th November 1770) went as a
young man to Venice, and quickly became known as an ardent collector of
books and objects of art generally. In 1740 he was appointed British
Consul at Venice. In 1762 Smith's library was bought for George III.,
and formed the first important nucleus of His Majesty's splendid collection.
It contained especially choice editions of the classics, and also many
incunabula.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith continued to collect books after the king had made his
purchase, and these were eventually sold by auction in 1773. George III.
also acquired a fine collection of pictures, coins, and gems that had been
brought together by Consul Smith.</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
<p>He was educated at Cambridge, where he attracted attention by his
ability and was given a special scholarship by Henry VIII. In 1531
Smith was made a Fellow of his College, and shortly afterwards University
Orator. In 1544 he was made Regius Professor of Civil Law. He was
Provost of Eton and Dean of Carlisle. Although in Orders, Smith
presently came to Court and became Clerk of the Privy Council, and in
1548 he was made one of the Secretaries to the King, and shortly afterwards
received the honour of Knighthood. He went as Ambassador to
the Emperor Charles V., and with an Embassy to France in 1551.</p>

<p>On the accession of Queen Mary, Smith changed his crest, and adopted
that of a salamander living in the midst of flames, alluding perhaps to the
fact that he escaped free from the dangers of the time, he being a strong
Protestant. The Smith crest before this had been an eagle holding a pen
in his claw. Queen Elizabeth in turn favoured Sir Thomas, and made
him Chancellor of the Order of the Garter, and soon afterwards Secretary
of State. Sir Thomas Smith had a large library of books, which he
bequeathed to one or other of the Colleges at Cambridge, or among
private friends. He wrote several works, mostly political.</p></div>

which he kept at Althorp.</p>

<p>In 1695 he was Member of Parliament for Tiverton; in 1706 he was
a Secretary of State for the Southern Department, and became of much
political importance as a Whig leader. He was appointed Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland in 1714.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
<p>Lord Sunderland was a great book collector, and a rival in this respect
to most of his contemporaries. He was a great gambler, and his library
was at one time pledged to the Duke of Marlborough, and in 1749 it was
removed to Blenheim. The library was sold in 1881, and the books
belonging to it were widely dispersed.</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland's son Charles, who in 1729 became fifth earl, on the
demise of his aunt Henrietta, by special Act of Parliament Duchess of
Marlborough, in 1733 succeeded to the Dukedom of the celebrated John
Churchill. The Earldom of Sunderland from that time has been merged
in the Dukedom of Marlborough.</p></div>

<p>Charles Stuart (born 2nd January 1779, died 6th November 1845) was
the son of General Sir Charles Stuart, K.C.B., son of the Earl of Bute.
Mr. Stuart had an important diplomatic career, and filled several high
posts. He was Charg&eacute; d'affaires at Madrid, Envoy to Portugal, Minister
at the Hague, and Ambassador to Paris.</p>

<p>In 1812 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the
Bath, and in 1828 he was created Baron Stuart de Rothesay, a high honour,
as the Barony of Rothesay is one of the hereditary honours of the Prince
of Wales. Lord Stuart was afterwards Ambassador to St. Petersburg. He
brought over from France the beautiful castle of Highcliffe, Hants, where
the German Emperor recently stayed. He left no male heir, so his
peerage became extinct at his death.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Sutton (born circ. 1532, died 12th December 1611) was the
son of Richard Sutton, Steward of the Courts of Lincoln. He is said to
have been educated at Eton, and afterwards studied law at Lincoln's Inn.
In early life Sutton was a soldier and saw active service, and in 1569 he
was appointed Master of the Ordnance in the North.</p>

<p>While in the north Sutton acquired considerable possessions in land,
and from these he drew a large fortune. One of the ships fitted out to
resist the Spanish Armada was called the "Sutton." Sutton was very
generous with his money, and in 1611 he purchased Charterhouse in
Middlesex, where he founded the famous school of that name. The
foundation of this school was originally intended for the benefit of forty
boys of good birth and necessitous parents, but in time it came about that
to be a foundation scholar, or gown boy, was a mark of distinction.
Thackeray was a Charterhouse boy and was familiar with the surroundings
there. Besides the school, there was a foundation or hospital at Charterhouse
for "poverty-stricken gentlemen." The school was moved to
Godalming in 1872, but the "hospital" still remains in Charterhouse
Square. Sutton's tomb is in the Chapel at the Charterhouse.</p></div>

<p>This stamp is generally found in combination with one or other of the
armorial stamps which I have figured and placed under the heading of
Henry VIII. No doubt there was some authority given to use these
Royal emblems, and although so far no reliable account of such authority
is forthcoming, it is likely enough that members of the Stationers'
Company may have been granted the privilege. On all these bindings
the coat-of-arms of the City of London appears. On many of them are
also initials which are very often those of well-known contemporary
printers and binders. The original stamps were cut in latten, a form of
brass&mdash;copper and zinc&mdash;and impressed on the leather in blind, that is
without gold, the design showing in low relief.</p>

<p>The latten plates were probably attached to wooden blocks by means
of two or more metal pins, and in many instances, by reason of irregular
pressure, these pins, the tops of which were engraved in continuation of
the general design, have been forced a little out of their normal level. The
result is that they show very clearly as indented marks. The pressure
necessary to make a good impression from one of these large stamps is
considerable; it may have been done by a slow constant pressure or by
quick pressure from hammer strokes, and the leather was in any case
softened by water. Bindings with these stamps upon them were either
of calf or sheep-skin.</p></div>

<p>Augustine Vincent (born circ. 1584, died 11th January 1625) was
the son of William Vincent. He showed antiquarian and heraldic tastes
at an early age, and in 1615 was made Rouge Rose Pursuivant, and in
1624 Windsor Herald. Vincent collected valuable material concerning
heraldic and genealogical matter, and his manuscripts are chiefly to be
found either at the College of Arms or the Bodleian Library at Oxford.</p>

<p>In Vincent's time it was the custom to carry out the heraldic visitations
by deputy. These visitations should have been made by the
Heralds in person, and in 1619 there was much trouble about the matter,
and strong complaints were made to the Earl Marshal by both Garter and
Norroy. The difficulty was brought to a head by the appointment of
Vincent, then Rouge Rose Pursuivant, to carry out the visitations of
Northamptonshire and Rutlandshire as deputy for William Camden,
Clarencieux Herald.</p></div>

<p>Edward Walker (born 24th January 1611, died 19th February 1676)
was the son of Edward Walker of Roobers, Nether Stowey, Somerset.
He joined the College of Arms as an official, and in 1635 he was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Blanch Lion Pursuivant, filling successively the positions of Rouge Croix
Pursuivant and Chester Herald.</p>

<p>Walker took part with Charles I. in the war with the Roundheads, and
served as Secretary-at-War, and was at Naseby. In 1644 he was created
Norroy King-of-Arms, and in 1645 he succeeded Sir Henry St. George
as Garter. In the same year he received the honour of Knighthood.
In 1649 Sir Edward Walker was made Clerk of the Council in
Ordinary, but in 1650 he got into trouble as a Royalist, and found
refuge in Holland. After some trouble he invested William, Prince of
Orange, with the Garter in 1653.</p>

<p>At the Restoration Walker superintended the arrangements for the
coronation, and his remaining years seem to have been spent in quarrels
with other members of the Heralds' College. Sir Edward Walker wrote
a considerable number of historical and genealogical works, particularly
an illustrated edition of the coronation of Charles II. Many of his
manuscripts are in the British Museum, and others are at the Bodleian
Library at Oxford.</p></div>

<p>Horace Walpole (born 5th October 1717, died 2nd March 1797) was
a younger son of Robert Walpole, Earl of Oxford, for many years Prime
Minister of England. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and as a
young man studied law. For a time Mr. Walpole served in the office of
the Exchequer, and represented Callington, Castle Rising, and King's
Lynn in Parliament, where the chief thing he did seems to have been
that he exerted himself to save the life of Admiral Byng.</p>

<p>In 1792 Mr. Walpole succeeded his nephew George in the Earldom,
but never took his seat in the House of Lords. On his death without
heirs most of his titles became extinct, but the Barony of Walpole
devolved on his cousin Horatio.</p>

<p>At Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, Walpole collected a splendid
library, and also a number of pictures, antiquities, and treasures of all
sorts. Here also he set up a private press, at which he printed many of
his own works. Many of Walpole's books are now famous; among the
best known are, perhaps, the <i>Anecdotes of Painting</i> and the <i>Castle of
Otranto</i>. The Strawberry Hill Collection was sold in 1840.</p></div>

The Prince of Orange deposed his father-in-law James II., in 1689, and
was declared king in his stead. William and Mary were, however, joint
sovereigns, and the crowns, sceptres, and orbs were all doubled for them,
and on the Great Seal they are both represented, one hand of each resting
on the orb.</p>

<p>Queen Mary died in 1694, and after that date King William reigned
alone. The same coat-of-arms was used all through, but during the double
reign the initials "WR" and "MR" are generally added. It is curious
to note that William III. several times altered the place of the coat-of-arms
of France on the English coat.</p></div>

<p>John Williams (born 25th March 1582, died 25th March 1650) was the
son of Edmond Williams of Conway, and was educated at Ruthin Grammar
School and at Cambridge. In 1603 he was ordained, and he soon became
known as an able preacher. After holding several minor ecclesiastical
preferments and enjoying the favour of James I., he was made Dean of
Salisbury in 1619. In 1620 Dr. Williams became Dean of Westminster,
and in 1621 he was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln. In the House of
Lords Bishop Williams took a very important part in the discussions and
legislation concerning the power of the Sovereign in 1628.</p>

<p>In 1635 the Bishop's enemies succeeded in bringing him before the
Star Chamber on a charge of subornation of perjury, and he was condemned
to a heavy fine and loss of profits of his many benefices. He was
imprisoned in the Tower until he was granted an unconditional release
by the House of Lords in 1640. In 1641, with other Bishops, Williams
was again committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason, but soon
escaped, forfeiting his bail. He again took a leading part in the proceedings
of the House of Lords, and was translated to the Archbishopric of York,
where he was enthroned in 1642.</p>

<p>Archbishop Williams worked hard for the Royalist cause; he fortified
Conway Castle and organised the militia. He was possessed of considerable
wealth, and was liberal and charitable. Several of his sermons and
speeches were published.</p></div>

<p>Edward Wotton (born circ. 1548, died circ. 1626) was the son of
Thomas Wotton by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Rudston,
Lord Mayor of London. Mr. Wotton was a man of much learning and
a great linguist, and in 1583 he was Member of Parliament for Kent.
He was Elizabeth's emissary to James VI. concerning his marriage, and
also about a treaty of alliance. In 1591 he received the honour of
Knighthood, and in 1602 he was Comptroller of the Household. In the
same year he was created Baron Wotton.</p>

<p>Lord Wotton was Lord Lieutenant of Kent, and Ambassador to
France and Treasurer of the Household. He inherited his father's library,
and in many cases added his own coat-of-arms impressed in silver to the
beautiful bindings made for Thomas Wotton, "The English Grolier,"
on whose books occur the legend <span class="smcap">THOMAE WOTTONI ET AMICORUM</span>.</p></div>

<p>James Wright (born circ. 1643, died October 1713) was the son of

His tastes were literary and antiquarian, and he possessed a considerable
library, chiefly manuscripts. Wright wrote a number of works on
antiquities, and others on the political matters of his time. The drama
also had much fascination for him, and he wrote several poems, and made
an epitome of Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>.</p></div>
